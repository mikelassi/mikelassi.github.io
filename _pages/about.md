`Hello World! I'm Michael.`
I am a second year Ph.D. student at the <a href= 'CNELab.github.io'>Computational Neuroengineering Laboratory</a>. My main research topic is the search for biomarkers in EEG and other physiological signals to describe and predict the evolution of neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease and stroke). 

I try to apply novel signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to clinical data to extract information that can be useful both from a clinical and neuroscientific perspective. I am eager to learn new topics, and I am currently focusing on deepening my ability in programming and my understanding of computational neuroscience.

In my free time, I like to read comics (Zerocalcare ‚ù§Ô∏è) and non-fiction books üìñ, I collect watches ‚åö and play some Switch games üéÆ.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.>

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
