	abstract = {Brain lesions caused by cerebral ischaemia lead to network disturbances in both hemispheres, causing a subsequent reorganization of functional connectivity both locally and remotely with respect to the injury. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods have long been used for exploring brain electrical activity and functional connectivity modifications after stroke. However, results obtained so far are not univocal. Here, we used basic and advanced EEG methods to characterize how brain activity and functional connectivity change after stroke. Thirty-three unilateral post stroke patients in the sub-acute phase and ten neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Patients were subdivided into two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, n=18) and subcortical (S, n=15), respectively. Stroke patients were evaluated in the period ranging from 45 days since the acute event (T0) up to 3 months after stroke (T1) with both neurophysiological (resting state EEG) and clinical assessment (Barthel Index, BI) measures, while healthy subjects were evaluated once. Brain power at T0 was similar between the two groups of patients in all frequency bands considered (δ, θ, α and β). However, evolution of θ-band power over time was different, with a normalization only in the CS group. Instead, average connectivity and specific network measures (Integration, Segregation and Small-worldness) in the β-band at T0 were significantly different between the two groups. The connectivity and network measures at T0 also appear to have a predictive role in functional recovery (BI T1-T0), again group-dependent. The results obtained in this study showed that connectivity measures and correlations between EEG features and recovery depend on lesion location. These data, if confirmed in further studies, on the one hand could explain the heterogeneity of results so far observed in previous studies, on the other hand they could be used by researchers as biomarkers predicting spontaneous recovery, to select homogenous groups of patients for the inclusion in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {The functional consequences of focal brain injury are thought to be contingent on neuronal alterations extending beyond the area of structural damage. This phenomenon, also known as diaschisis, has clinical and metabolic correlates but lacks a clear electrophysiological counterpart, except for the long-standing evidence of a relative EEG slowing over the injured hemisphere. Here, we aim at testing whether this EEG slowing is linked to the pathological intrusion of sleep-like cortical dynamics within an awake brain. We used a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) to study cortical reactivity in a cohort of 30 conscious awake patients with chronic focal and multifocal brain injuries of ischaemic, haemorrhagic and traumatic aetiology. We found that different patterns of cortical reactivity typically associated with different brain states (coma, sleep, wakefulness) can coexist within the same brain. Specifically, we detected the occurrence of prominent sleep-like TMS-evoked slow waves and off-periods-reflecting transient suppressions of neuronal activity-in the area surrounding focal cortical injuries. These perilesional sleep-like responses were associated with a local disruption of signal complexity whereas complex responses typical of the awake brain were present when stimulating the contralesional hemisphere. These results shed light on the electrophysiological properties of the tissue surrounding focal brain injuries in humans. Perilesional sleep-like off-periods can disrupt network activity but are potentially reversible, thus representing a principled read-out for the neurophysiological assessment of stroke patients, as well as an interesting target for rehabilitation.},

Recent literature suggests to apply a stratification based on lesion location and to consider patients with cortico-subcortical and subcortical strokes separately: different lesion location may also influence therapeutic response. In this study we used a longitudinal approach to perform TMS assessment (Motor Evoked Potentials, MEP, and Silent Period, SP) and clinical evaluations (Barthel Index, Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper limb motor function and Wolf Motor Function Test) in 10 cortical-subcortical and 10 subcortical ischemic stroke patients. Evaluations were performed in a window between 10 and 45 days (t0) and at 3 months after the acute event (t1). Our main finding is that 3 months after the acute event patients affected by subcortical stroke presented a reduction in contralateral SP duration in the unaffected hemisphere; this trend is related to clinical improvement of upper limb motor function. In conclusion, SP proved to be a valid parameter to characterize cortical reorganization patterns in stroke survivors and provided useful information about motor recovery within three months in subcortical patients.},

	abstract = {A brain injury resulting from unilateral stroke critically alters brain functionality and the complex balance within the cortical activity. Such modifications may critically depend on lesion location and cortical involvement. Indeed, recent findings pointed out the necessity of applying a stratification based on lesion location when investigating inter-hemispheric balance in stroke. Here, we tested whether cortical involvement could imply differences in band-specific activity and brain symmetry in post stroke patients with cortico-subcortical and subcortical strokes. We explored brain activity related to lesion location through EEG power analysis and quantitative EEG (qEEG) measures. Thirty stroke patients in the subacute phase and 10 neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Stroke patients were equally subdivided in two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, mean age ± SD: 72.21 ± 10.97 years; time since stroke ± SD: 31.14 ± 11.73 days) and subcortical (S, mean age ± SD: 68.92 ± 10.001 years; time since stroke ± SD: 26.93 ± 13.08 days) group. We assessed patients’ neurological status by means of NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). High density EEG at rest was recorded and power spectral analysis in Delta (1-4 Hz) and Alpha (8-14 Hz) bands was performed. Quantitative EEG metrics as pairwise derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI) and Delta/Alpha Ratio (DAR) were computed and correlated with NIHSS score. S showed a lower Delta power in the unaffected hemisphere compared to affected hemisphere (z= -1.98, p{\textless}0.05) and a higher Alpha power compared to CS (z= -2.18, p{\textless}0.05). pdBSI was negatively correlated with NIHSS (R= -0.59, p{\textless}0.05). CS showed a higher value and symmetrical distribution of Delta band activity (z= -2.37, p{\textless}0.05), confirmed also by a higher DAR value compared to S (z= -2.48, p{\textless}0.05). Patients with cortico-subcortical and subcortical lesions show different brain symmetry in the subacute phase. Interestingly, in subcortical stroke patient brain activity is related with the clinical function. Quantitative EEG measures can be explicative of brain activity related to lesion location and they could allow precise definition of diagnostic-therapeutic algorithms in stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Stroke lesions induce not only loss of local neural function, but disruptions in spatially distributed areas. However, it is unknown whether they affect the synchrony of electrical oscillations in neural networks and if changes in network coherence are associated with neurological deficits. This study assessed these questions in a population of patients with subacute, unilateral, ischemic stroke.Spontaneous cortical oscillations were reconstructed from high-resolution electroencephalograms (EEG) with adaptive spatial filters. Maps of functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas were created and correlated with patient performance in motor and cognitive scores.In comparison to age matched healthy controls, stroke patients showed a selective disruption of FC in the alpha frequency range. The spatial distribution of alpha band FC reflected the pattern of motor and cognitive deficits of the individual patient: network nodes that participate normally in the affected functions showed local decreases in FC with the rest of the brain. Interregional FC in the alpha band, but not in delta, theta, or beta frequencies, was highly correlated with motor and cognitive performance. In contrast, FC between contralesional areas and the rest of the brain was negatively associated with patient performance.Alpha oscillation synchrony at rest is a unique and specific marker of network function and linearly associated with behavioral performance. Maps of alpha synchrony computed from a single resting-state EEG recording provide a robust and convenient window into the functionality and organization of cortical networks with numerous potential applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective: The nonlesioned motor cortex (M1NL) is thought to be hyperexcitable in patients with subacute or chronic stroke and offers a promising therapeutic target. However, whether M1NL excitability behaves the same for subcortical and cortical strokes is unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine whether cortical, or purely subcortical, strokes have a different effect on M1NL excitability.

Methods: We looked for correlations between the Fugl-Meyer (FM) score and M1NL resting motor threshold (RMTNL) in 34 stroke survivors classified according to lesion location (cortico-subcortical or purely subcortical). In addition to the FM, the Wolf Motor Score and motor power were measured.

Results: FM correlated with RMTNL for subcortical ( r = 0.82; p = 0.001) but not for cortical strokes ( r = 0.11; p = 0.62). Likewise, Wolf Motor Score ( r = −0.62; p = 0.03) and motor power ( r = 0.64; p = 0.023) were correlated with RMTNL for the subcortical group, but not for the cortical group.

Conclusion: We show that the impact on M1NL depends on lesion location and conclude that protocols aimed at reducing M1NL cortical excitability may be worth exploring for subcortical but not for cortical stroke.

	doi = {10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2003.10.026},
	abstract = {Recovery of motor function after stroke is associated with reorganization in central motor networks. Functional imaging has demonstrated recovery-dependent alterations in brain activation patterns when compared to healthy controls. These alterations are variable across stroke subjects. Factors identified as contributing to this variability are the degree of functional impairment, the time interval since stroke, and rehabilitative therapies. Here, the hypothesis is tested that lesion location influences the activation patterns. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the objective was to characterize similarities or differences in movement-related activation patterns in patients chronically disabled by cortical plus subcortical or subcortical lesions only. Brain activation was mapped during paretic and non-paretic movement in 11 patients with subcortical stroke, in nine patients with stroke involving sensorimotor cortex, and in eight healthy volunteers. Patient groups had similar average motor deficit as measured by a battery of scores and strength measures. Substantial differences between patients groups were found in activation patterns associated with paretic limb movement: Whereas contralateral motor cortex, ipsilateral cerebellum (relative to moving limb), bilateral mesial (cingulate, SMA), and perisylvian regions were active in subcortical stroke, cortical patients recruited only ipsilateral postcentral mesial hemisphere regions, and areas at the rim of the stroke cavity. For both groups, activation in ipsilateral postcentral cortex correlated with motor function; in subcortical stroke, the same was found for mesial and perisylvian regions. Overall, brain activation in cortical stroke was less, while in subcortical patients, more than in healthy controls. For non-paretic movement, activation patterns were similar to control in cortical patients. In subcortical patients, however, activation patterns differed: the activation of non-paretic movement was similar to that of paretic movement (corrected for side). The data demonstrate more differences than similarities in the central control of paretic and non-paretic limb movement in patients chronically disabled by subcortical versus cortical stroke. Whereas standard motor circuitry is utilized in subcortical stroke, alternative networks are recruited after cortical stroke. This finding proposes lesion-specific mechanisms of reorganization. Optimal activation of these distinct networks may require different rehabilitative strategies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13'14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Recent studies indicate that, at the population level, post-stroke neurological impairments cluster in three sets of correlated deficits across different behavioural domains. To examine the reproducibility and specificity of this structure, we prospectively studied first-time stroke patients (n = 237) using a bedside, clinically applicable, neuropsychological assessment and compared the behavioural and anatomical results with those obtained from a different prospective cohort studied with an extensive neuropsychological battery. The behavioural assessment at 1-week post-stroke included the Oxford Cognitive Screen and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. A principal component analysis was used to reduce variables and describe behavioural variance across patients. Lesions were manually segmented on structural scans. The relationship between anatomy and behaviour was analysed using multivariate regression models. Three principal components explained ≈50\% of the behavioural variance across subjects. PC1 loaded on language, calculation, praxis, right side neglect and memory deficits; PC2 loaded on left motor, visual and spatial neglect deficits; PC3 loaded on right motor deficits. These components matched those obtained with a more extensive battery. The underlying lesion anatomy was also similar. Neurological deficits following stroke are correlated in a low-dimensional structure of impairment, related neither to the damage of a specific area or vascular territory. Rather they reflect widespread network impairment caused by focal lesions. These factors showed consistency across different populations, neurobehavioural batteries and, most importantly, can be described using a combination of clinically applicable batteries (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Oxford Cognitive Screen). They represent robust behavioural biomarkers for future stroke population studies.},

We studied a large prospective sample of first-time stroke patients with heterogeneous lesions at 1-2weeks post-stroke. We measured behavior over multiple domains and lesion anatomy with structural MRI and a probabilistic atlasof white matter pathways. Multivariate methods estimated the percentage of behavioral variance explained by structural damage. A few clusters of behavioral deficits spanning multiple functions explained neurological impairment. Stroke topography was predominantly subcortical, and disconnection of white matter tracts critically contributed to behavioral deficits and their correlation. The locus of damage explained more variance for motor and language than memory or attention deficits. Our findings highlight the need for better models of white matter damage on cognition.},

As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is important to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation is the standard approach for evaluating the accuracy of such algorithms; however, several cross-validations methods exist and only some of them are statistically meaningful. Here we compared two popular cross-validation methods: record-wise and subject-wise. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise cross-validation often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also found that this erroneous method is used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes. As we move towards an era of machine learning based diagnosis and treatment, using proper methods to evaluate their accuracy is crucial, as erroneous results can mislead both clinicians and data scientists.},

EEG–EMG coherence increased over time, as wrist mobility recovered clinically, and by the final evaluation, coherence was higher in the patient group than in the healthy controls. Moreover, the cortical distribution differed between the groups, with coherence involving larger and more bilaterally scattered areas of cortex in the patients than in the healthy participants.

Here, we aim to investigate factors that modulate the variation of CMC amplitude and compare significant CMC between these factors to find a well-developed research prospect. In the present review, we discuss the mechanism of CMC and propose a general definition of CMC. Factors affecting CMC are also summarized as follows: experimental design, band frequencies and force levels, age correlation, and difference between healthy controls and patients. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of the current CMC applications for various motor disorders. Further recognition of the factors affecting CMC amplitude can clarify the physiological mechanism and is beneficial to the implementation of CMC clinical methods.},

	abstract = {Motor dysfunction is a major consequence after stroke and it is generally believed that the loss of motor ability is caused by the impairments in neural network that controls movement. To explore the abnormal mechanisms how the brain controls shoulder abduction and elbow flexion in “flexion synergy” following stroke, we used the functional corticomuscular coupling (FCMC) between the brain and the muscles as a tool to identify the temporal evolution of corticomuscular interaction between the synkinetic and separate phases. 59-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) over brain scalp and 2-channel electromyogram (EMG) from biceps brachii (BB)/deltoid (DT) were recorded in sixteen stroke patients with motor dysfunction and eight healthy controls during a task of uplifting the arm (stage 1) and maintaining up to the chest (stage 2). As a result, compared to healthy controls, stroke patients had abnormally reduced coherence in EEG-BB combination and increased coherence in EEG-DT combination. Compared to synkinetic stroke patients, separate ones exhibited higher coupling at gamma-band during stage 1 and higher at beta-band during stage 2 in EEG-BB combination, but lower at beta-band during stage 2 in EEG-DT combination. Therefore, we infer that the disorders of efferent control and afferent proprioception in sensorimotor system for stroke patients effect on the oscillation at beta and gamma bands. Patients need integrate more information for shoulder abduction to compensate for the functional loss of elbow flexion in the recovery process, so that partial cortical cortex controlling on the elbow flexion may work on the shoulder abduction during “flexion synergy”. Such researches could provide new perspective on the temporal evolution of corticomuscular interaction after stroke and add to our understanding of possible pathomechanisms how the brain abnormally controls shoulder abduction and elbow flexion in “flexion synergy”.},

On the contrary, recent evidence suggests that in humans the motor cortex is also significantly engaged during complex locomotion tasks. However, a detailed understanding of cortical contribution to locomotion is still lacking especially during stereotyped activities. Here, we show that cortical motor areas finely control leg muscle activation during treadmill stereotyped walking. Using a novel technique based on a combination of Reliable Independent Component Analysis, source localization and effective connectivity, and by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings in able-bodied adults we were able to examine for the first time cortical activation patterns and cortico-muscular connectivity including information flow direction. Results not only provided evidence of cortical activity associated with locomotion, but demonstrated significant causal unidirectional drive from contralateral motor cortex to muscles in the swing leg. These insights overturn the traditional view that human cortex has a limited role in the control of stereotyped locomotion, and suggest useful hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying gait under other conditions.

So far, electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) have been used, separately, to investigate the cortical regions of the human brain which may be involved in activating muscle synergies. Here we aim at extending these results by looking for a hierarchical relationship between cortical and muscular sources of activity (neuro-muscular synergies) with a unified analysis of independent components (IC) simultaneously extracted from both EEG and EMG signals. We show for the first time how the direct fusion of EEG and EMG signals to extract unified ICs (unICs) can overcome the limitations of previous approaches, i.e., the difficulty in linking neural with muscular activations, and the lack of reliability of separate preprocessing techniques. Our results show that unified ICs were physiologically meaningful components in agreement with previous works. UNICA (Unified Independent Component Analysis) can also be considered as a solution for estimating overcomplete ICA on EEG and EMG data. These findings are an important step towards an understanding of the cortical control of human muscles synergies, and may have important applications for understanding movement dysfunction and to develop novel approaches for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprostheses.},

This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of reflecting the motor function improvement after stroke with the measurement of corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in an individual subject. Method: A stroke patient was recruited to participate in an experiment before and after the function recovery of his paretic upper limb respectively. An elbow flexion task with a constant muscle contraction level was involved in the experiment. Electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded simultaneously to estimate the corticomuscular coherence. The non-parameter statistical analysis was used to test the significance of CMC differences between the first and second times of experiments. Result: The strongest corticomuscular coupling emerged at the motor cortex contralateral to the contracting muscles for both the affected and unaffected limbs. The strength of the corticomuscular coupling between activities from the paretic limb muscles and the contralateral motor cortex for the second time of experiment increased significantly compared with that for the first time. However, the corticomuscular coherence of the unaffected limb had no significant changes between two times of experiments. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the increased corticomuscular coupling strength resulted from the motor function restoration of the paretic limb. The measure of corticomuscular coherence can reflect the recovery of motor function after stroke by quantifying interactions between activities from the motor cortex and controlled muscles.},

However, the cortical origin of this compensation has not been well understood. In this study, corticomuscular coherence (CMCoh) and electromyography (EMG) analysis were adopted to investigate corticomuscular coordinating mechanism of post-stroke compensatory activities of proximal UE in distal motions of the affected hands. Method: Fourteen chronic stroke subjects and ten age-matched unimpaired controls conducted isometric finger extensions and flexions at 20\% and 40\% of maximal voluntary contractions. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from the sensorimotor area and EMG signals were captured from extensor digitorum (ED), flexor digitorum (FD), triceps brachii (TRI), and biceps brachii (BIC) to investigate the CMCoh peak values in the Beta band. EMG parameters (i.e. the EMG activation level and co-contraction index) were analyzed to evaluate the compensatory muscular patterns in the upper limb. Result: The peak CMCoh with statistical significance (?{\textless}0.05) was found shifted from the contralateral side to the ipsilateral side in the proximal UE muscles; while to the central regions in the distal UE muscle in chronic strokes. Significant differences (P{\textless}0.05) were observed in both peak ED and FD CMCohs during finger extensions between the two groups. The unimpaired controls exhibited significant intragroup differences between 20\% and 40\% levels in extensions for peak ED and FD CMCohs (P{\textless}0.05). The stroke subjects showed significance differences in peak TRI and BIC CMCohs (P{\textless}0.01). No significant inter- or intra-group difference was observed in peak CMCoh during finger flexions. EMG parameters showed higher EMG activation levels in TRI and BIC muscles (P{\textless}0.05), and higher CI values in the muscle pairs involving TRI and BIC during all the extension and flexion tasks in the stroke group than those in the control group (P{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the functional connection between motor cortex and muscles, we measured electroencephalogram-electromyogram (EEG-EMG) coherence of stroke patients and controls. Methods: Eight healthy controls and 21 patients with shoulder and elbow coordination deficits were enrolled. All subjects performed a reaching task involving shoulder flexion and elbow extension. EMG of the anterior deltoid (AD) and brachii muscles (BB, TB) and 64-channel scalp EEG were recorded during the task. Time-frequency coherence was calculated using the bivariate autoregressive model. Results: Stroke patients had significantly lower corticomuscular coherence compared with healthy controls for the AD and BB muscles at both the beta (20-30 Hz) and lower gamma (30-40 Hz) bands during the movement. BH procedure (FDR) identified a reduced corticomuscular coherence for stroke patients in 11 of 15 scalp area-muscle combinations. There was no statistically significant difference between stroke patients and control subjects according to coherence in other frequency bands. Conclusion: Poorly recovered stroke survivors with persistent upper-limb motor deficits exhibited significantly lower gamma-band corticomuscular coherence in performing a reaching task. Significance: The study suggests poor brain-muscle communication or poor integration of the EEG and EMG signals in higher frequency band during reaching task may reflect an underlying mechanism producing movement deficits post-stroke. © 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

	abstract = {Given the importance of neuronal plasticity in recovery from a stroke and the huge variability of recovery abilities in patients, we investigated neuronal activity in the acute phase to enhance information about the prognosis of recovery in the stabilized phase. We investigated the microstates in 47 patients who suffered a first-ever mono-lesional ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory and in 20 healthy control volunteers. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at rest with eyes closed was acquired between 2 and 10 days (T0) after ischemic attack. Objective criteria allowed for the selection of an optimal number of microstates. Clinical condition was quantified by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) both in acute (T0) and stabilized (T1, 5.4 ± 1.7 months) phases and Effective Recovery (ER) was calculated as (NIHSS(T1)-NIHSS(T0))/NIHSS(T0). The microstates A, B, C and D emerged as the most stable. In patients with a left lesion inducing a language impairment, microstate C topography differed from controls. Microstate D topography was different in patients with a right lesion inducing neglect symptoms. In patients, the C vs D microstate duration differed after both a left and a right lesion with respect to controls (C lower than D in left and D lower than C in right lesion). A preserved microstate B in acute phase correlated with a better effective recovery. A regression model indicated that the microstate B duration explained the 11\% of ER variance. This first ever study of EEG microstates in acute stroke opens an interesting path to identify neuronal impairments with prognostic relevance, to develop enriched compensatory treatments to drive a better individual recovery.},

To the extent that this is true, recovery from stroke can be predicted accurately from baseline measures of acute post-stroke impairment alone. Reports that baseline scores explain more than 80\%, and sometimes more than 90\%, of the variance in the patients' recoveries, are rapidly accumulating. Here, we show that these headline effect sizes are likely inflated. The key effects in this literature are typically expressed as, or reducible to, correlation coefficients between baseline scores and recovery (outcome scores minus baseline scores). Using formal analyses and simulations, we show that these correlations will be extreme when outcomes are significantly less variable than baselines, which they often will be in practice regardless of the real relationship between outcomes and baselines. We show that these effect sizes are likely to be over-optimistic in every empirical study that we found that reported enough information for us to make the judgement, and argue that the same is likely to be true in other studies as well. The implication is that recovery after stroke may not be as proportional as recent studies suggest.},

	abstract = {Objective: To analyse magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals with Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) to identify the regions of the brain showing changes related to cognitive decline and Alzheimeŕs Disease (AD). Methods: LZC was used to study MEG signals in the source space from 99 participants (36 male, 63 female, average age: 71.82 ± 4.06) in three groups (33 subjects per group): healthy (control) older adults, older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Analyses were performed in broadband (2–45 Hz) and in classic narrow bands (theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), low beta (12–20 Hz), high beta (20–30 Hz), and, gamma (30–45 Hz)). Results: LZC was significantly lower in subjects with MCI than in those with SCD. Moreover, subjects with MCI had significantly lower MEG complexity than controls and SCD subjects in the beta frequency band. Lower complexity was correlated with smaller hippocampal volumes. Conclusions: Brain complexity – measured with LZC – decreases in MCI patients when compared to SCD and healthy controls. This decrease is associated with a decrease in hippocampal volume, a key feature in AD progression.

	abstract = {Introduction Neuronal oscillations synchronize processing in the brain over large spatiotemporal scales and thereby facilitate integration of individual functional modules. Up to now, the relation between the phases of neuronal oscillations and behavior or perception has mainly been analyzed in sensor space of multivariate EEG/MEG recordings. However, sensor-space analysis distorts the topographies of the underlying neuronal sources and suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio. Instead, we propose an optimized source reconstruction approach (Phase Coupling Optimization, PCO). Methods PCO maximizes the ‘mean vector length’, calculated from the phases of recovered neuronal sources and a target variable of interest (e.g., experimental performance). As pre-processing, the signal-to-noise ratio in the search-space is maximized by spatio-spectral decomposition. PCO was benchmarked against several competing algorithms and sensor-space analysis using realistic forward model simulations. As a practical example, thirteen 96-channel EEG measurements during a simple reaction time task were analyzed. After time-frequency decomposition, PCO was applied to the EEG to examine the relation between the phases of pre-stimulus EEG activity and reaction times. Results In simulations, PCO outperformed other spatial optimization approaches and sensor-space analysis. Scalp topographies of the underlying source patterns and the relation between the phases of the source activity and the target variable could be reconstructed accurately even for very low SNRs (−10 dB). In a simple reaction time experiment, the phases of pre-stimulus delta waves ({\textless}0.1 Hz) with widely distributed fronto-parietal source topographies were found predictive of the reaction times. Discussion and conclusions From multivariate recordings, PCO can reconstruct neuronal sources that are phase-coupled to a target variable using a data-driven optimization approach. Its superiority has been shown in simulations and in the analysis of a simple reaction time experiment. From this data, we hypothesize that the phase entrainment of slow delta waves ({\textless}1 Hz) facilitates sensorimotor integration in the brain and that this mechanism underlies the faster processing of anticipated stimuli. We further propose that the examined slow delta waves, observed to be phase-coupled to reaction times, correspond to the compound potentials typically observed in paradigms of stimulus anticipation and motor preparation.},

Methods: Twenty participants with AD, 30 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 20 with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and 22 healthy controls (HC) were examined with a detailed neuropsychological battery and 10 min resting state HD-EEG. We extracted correlation matrices by using Pearson correlation coefficients for each subject and constructed weighted undirected networks for calculating clustering coefficient (CC), strength (S) and betweenness centrality (BC) at global (256 electrodes) and local levels (29 parietal electrodes). Results: One-way ANOVA presented a statistically significant difference among the four groups at local level in CC [F (3, 88) = 4.76, p = 0.004] and S [F (3, 88) = 4.69, p = 0.004]. However, no statistically significant difference was found at a global level. According to the independent sample t-test, local CC was higher for HC [M (SD) = 0.79 (0.07)] compared with SCD [M (SD) = 0.72 (0.09)]; t (40) = 2.39, p = 0.02, MCI [M (SD) = 0.71 (0.09)]; t (50) = 0.41, p = 0.004 and AD [M (SD) = 0.68 (0.11)]; t (40) = 3.62, p = 0.001 as well, while BC showed an increase at a local level but a decrease at a global level as the disease progresses. These findings provide evidence that disruptions in brain networks in parietal organization may potentially represent a key factor in the ability to distinguish people at early stages of the AD continuum. Conclusions: The above findings reveal a dynamically disrupted network organization of preclinical stages, showing that SCD exhibits network disorganization with intermediate values between MCI and HC. Additionally, these pieces of evidence provide information on the usefulness of the 256 HD-EEG in network construction.},

Methods: From 5 Nordic memory clinics, we included 47 SCD patients, 99 MCI patients, and 67 healthy controls. EEGs analyzed with the SPR method together with clinical data recorded at base-line were evaluated. The patients were followed up for a mean of 62.5 (SD 17.6) months and reexamined. Results: Of 200 participants with valid clinical information, 70 had converted to dementia, and 52 had developed Alzheimer's disease. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis of the EEG results as defined by a dementia index (DI) ranging from 0 to 100 revealed that the area under the curve was 0.78 (95\% CI 0.70-0.85), corresponding to a sensitivity of 71\%, specificity of 69\%, and accuracy of 69\%. A logistic regression analysis showed that by adding results of a cognitive test at baseline to the EEG DI, accuracy could improve. Conclusion: We conclude that applying qEEG using the automated SPR method can be helpful in identifying patients with SCD and MCI that have a high risk of converting to dementia over a 5-year period. As the discriminant power of the method is of moderate degree, it should be used in addition to routine diagnostic methods.},

	abstract = {A brain microstate is defined as a functional/physiological state of the brain during which specific neural computations are performed. It is characterized uniquely by a fixed spatial distribution of active neuronal generators with time varying intensity. Brain electrical activity is modeled as being composed of a time sequence of nonoverlapping microstates with variable duration. A precise mathematical formulation of the model for evoked potential recordings is presented, where the microstates are represented as normalized vectors constituted by scalp electric potentials due to the underlying generators. An algorithm is developed for estimating the microstates, based on a modified version of the classical k-means clustering method, in which cluster orientations are estimated. Consequently, each instantaneous multichannel evoked potential measurement is classified as belonging to some microstate, thus producing a natural segmentation of brain activity. Use is made of statistical image segmentation techniques for obtaining smooth continuous segments. Time varying intensities are estimated by projecting the measurements onto their corresponding microstates. A goodness of fit statistic for the model is presented. Finally, a method is introduced for estimating the number of microstates, based on nonparametric data-driven statistical resampling techniques. © 1995 IEEE},

	abstract = {Nowadays, motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification has become a hotspot in the research field of brain computer interface (BCI). More recently, deep learning has emerged as a promising technique to automatically extract features of raw MI EEG signals and then classify them. However, deep learning-based methods still face two challenging problems in practical MI EEG signal classification applications: (1) Generally, training a deep learning model successfully needs a large amount of labeled data. However, most of the EEG signal data is unlabeled and it is quite difficult or even impossible for human experts to label all the signal samples manually. (2) It is extremely time-consuming and computationally expensive to train a deep learning model from scratch. To cope with these two challenges, a deep transfer convolutional neural network (CNN) framework based on VGG-16 is proposed for EEG signal classification. The proposed framework consists of a VGG-16 CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet and a target CNN model which shares the same structure with VGG-16 except for the softmax output layer. The parameters of the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model are directly transferred to the target CNN model used for MI EEG signal classification. Then, front-layers parameters in the target model are frozen, while later-layers parameters are fine-tuned by the target MI dataset. The target dataset is composed of time-frequency spectrum images of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed framework is verified on the public benchmark dataset 2b from the BCI competition IV. The experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the accuracy and efficiency performance of EEG signal classification compared with traditional methods, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and standard CNN.},

	abstract = {Despite progress in using computational approaches to inform medicine and neuroscience in the last 30 years, there have been few attempts to model the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor rehabilitation. We argue that a fundamental understanding of neurologic recovery, and as a result accurate predictions at the individual level, will be facilitated by developing computational models of the salient neural processes, including plasticity and learning systems of the brain, and integrating them into a context specific to rehabilitation. Here, we therefore discuss Computational Neurorehabilitation, a newly emerging field aimed at modeling plasticity and motor learning to understand and improve movement recovery of individuals with neurologic impairment. We first explain how the emergence of robotics and wearable sensors for rehabilitation is providing data that make development and testing of such models increasingly feasible. We then review key aspects of plasticity and motor learning that such models will incorporate. We proceed by discussing how computational neurorehabilitation models relate to the current benchmark in rehabilitation modeling - regression-based, prognostic modeling. We then critically discuss the first computational neurorehabilitation models, which have primarily focused on modeling rehabilitation of the upper extremity after stroke, and show how even simple models have produced novel ideas for future investigation. Finally, we conclude with key directions for future research, anticipating that soon we will see the emergence of mechanistic models of motor recovery that are informed by clinical imaging results and driven by the actual movement content of rehabilitation therapy as well as wearable sensor-based records of daily activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Structural brain networks possess a few hubs, which are not only highly connected to the rest of the brain but are also highly connected to each other. These hubs, which form a rich-club, play a central role in global brain organization. To investigate whether the concept of rich-club sheds new light on poststroke recovery, we applied a novel network-theoretical quantification of lesions to patients with stroke and compared the outcomes with what lesion size alone would indicate. METHODS Whole-brain structural networks of 73 patients with ischemic stroke were reconstructed using diffusion-weighted imaging data. Disconnectomes, a new type of network analyses, were constructed using only those fibers that pass through the lesion. Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scores and their changes were used to determine whether the patients show natural recovery or not. RESULTS Cluster analysis revealed 3 patient clusters: small-lesion-good-recovery, midsized-lesion-poor-recovery (MLPR), and large-lesion-poor-recovery (LLPR). The small-lesion-good-recovery consisted of subjects whose lesions were small, and whose prospects for recovery were relatively good. To explain the nondifference in recovery between the MLPR and LLPR clusters despite the difference (LLPR{\textgreater}MLPR) in lesion volume, we defined the [Formula: see text] metric to be the sum of the entries in the disconnectome and, more importantly, the [Formula: see text] to be the sum of all entries in the disconnectome corresponding to edges with at least one node in the rich-club. Unlike lesion volume and corticospinal tract damage (MLPR{\textless}LLPR), for [Formula: see text], this relationship was reversed (MLPR{\textgreater}LLPR) or showed no difference for [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS Smaller lesions that focus on the rich-club can be just as devastating as much larger lesions that do not focus on the rich-club, pointing to the role of the rich-club as a backbone for functional communication within brain networks and for recovery from stroke.},

	abstract = {After cerebral ischemia, disruption and subsequent reorganization of functional connections occur both locally and remote to the lesion. However, the unpredictable timing and extent of sensorimotor recovery reflects a gap in understanding of these underlying neural mechanisms. We aimed to identify the plasticity of alpha-band functional neural connections within the perilesional area and the predictive value of functional connectivity with respect to motor recovery of the upper extremity after stroke. Our results show improvements in upper extremity motor recovery in relation to distributed changes in MEG-based alpha band functional connectivity, both in the perilesional area and contralesional cortex. Motor recovery was found to be predicted by increased connectivity at baseline in the ipsilesional somatosensory area, supplementary motor area, and cerebellum, contrasted with reduced connectivity of contralesional motor regions, after controlling for age, stroke onset-time and lesion size. These findings support plasticity within a widely distributed neural network and define brain regions in which the extent of network participation predicts post-stroke recovery potential. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Clinical research based on neuroimaging data has benefited from machine learning methods, which have the ability to provide individualized predictions and to account for the interaction among units of information in the brain. Application of machine learning in structural imaging to investigate diseases that involve brain injury presents an additional challenge, especially in conditions like stroke, due to the high variability across patients regarding characteristics of the lesions. Extracting data from anatomical images in a way that translates brain damage information into features to be used as input to learning algorithms is still an open question. One of the most common approaches to capture regional information from brain injury is to obtain the lesion load per region (i.e. the proportion of voxels in anatomical structures that are considered to be damaged). However, no systematic evaluation has yet been performed to compare this approach with using patterns of voxels (i.e. considering each voxel as a single feature). In this paper we compared both approaches applying Gaussian Process Regression to decode motor scores in 50 chronic stroke patients based solely on data derived from structural MRI. For both approaches we compared different ways to delimit anatomical areas: regions of interest from an anatomical atlas, the corticospinal tract, a mask obtained from fMRI analysis with a motor task in healthy controls and regions selected using lesion-symptom mapping. Our analysis showed that extracting features through patterns of voxels that represent lesion probability produced better results than quantifying the lesion load per region. In particular, from the different ways to delimit anatomical areas compared, the best performance was obtained with a combination of a range of cortical and subcortical motor areas as well as the corticospinal tract. These results will inform the appropriate methodology for predicting long term motor outcomes from early post-stroke structural brain imaging.},

Although significant corticomuscular connectivity during walking has been reported, the level at which the cortical activity is involved in muscle activity (muscle synergy or individual muscle level)remains unclear. Here we examined cortical correlates of muscle activation during walking by brain decoding of activation of muscle synergies and individual muscles from electroencephalographic signals. We demonstrated that the activation of locomotor muscle synergies was decoded from slow cortical waves. In addition, the decoding accuracy for muscle synergies was greater than that for individual muscles and the decoding of individual muscle activation was based on muscle-synergy-related cortical information. These results indicate the cortical correlates of locomotor muscle synergy activation. These findings expand our understanding of the relationships between brain and locomotor muscle synergies and could accelerate the development of effective brain-machine interfaces for walking rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Objective: While neuroplasticity and functional reorganization during motor recovery can be indirectly reflected and evaluated by functional corticomuscular coupling (fCMC), little work has been published regarding the cortical origin of abnormal muscle synergy and compensatory mechanism in the separation movement of stroke patients. Methods: In this study, we proposed to use extended partial directed coherence (ePDC) combined with an optimal spatial filtering approach to estimate fCMC in stroke patients and healthy controls, and further established muscle synergy model (MSM) to jointly explore the modulation mechanism between cortex and muscles. Results: Compared to healthy controls, stroke patients had significantly reduced coupling strength in both descending and ascending pathway. Moreover, the MSM were abnormal with high variability and low similarity in the separation stage of stroke patients. Further exploration of the positive relationship between fCMC characteristics and MSM parameters proved the possibility of using fCMC-MSM-based correlation indicator to evaluate abnormality of the cortical related synergy movement as well as the rehabilitation level of stroke patients. Conclusion: We developed a computational procedure to evaluate the correlation between fCMC and MSM in stroke patients. Significance: This article provides a quantitative evaluation metrics based on fCMC to reveal the deficits during poststroke motor restoration and a promising approach to help patients correct abnormal movement habits, paving the way for neurophysiological assessment of neuromuscular control in conjunction with clinical scores.},

	abstract = {Currently, the relevance of EEG measurements in acute stroke patients is considered low in clinical practice. However, recent studies on the predictive value of EEG measurements after stroke for various outcomes may increase the role of EEG in patients with stroke. We aimed to review the current literature on the utility of EEG measurements after stroke as a tool to predict outcome and complications, focusing on studies in which the EEG measurement was performed in the acute phase after the event and in which long-term outcome measures were reported. In our literature review, we identified 4 different outcome measures (functional outcome, mortality, development of post-stroke cognitive decline, and development of post-stroke epilepsy) where studies on the utility of acute EEG measurements exist. There is a large body of evidence for the prediction of functional outcome, in which a multitude of associated quantitative and qualitative EEG parameters are described. In contrast, only few studies focus on mortality as outcome parameter. We found studies of high methodical quality on the prediction of post-stroke cognitive decline, though the number of patients in these studies often was small. The role of EEG as a prediction tool for seizures and epilepsy after stroke could increase after a recently published study, especially if its result can be incorporated into already existing post-stroke epilepsy prediction tools. In summary, EEG is useful for the prediction of functional outcome, mortality, development of post-stroke cognitive decline and epilepsy, even though there is a discrepancy between the large amount of studies on EEG in acute stroke patients and its underuse in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Abstract Brain areas within the motor system interact directly or indirectly during motor-imagery and motor-execution tasks. These interactions and their functionality can change following stroke and recovery. How brain network interactions reorganize and recover their functionality during recovery and treatment following stroke are not well understood. To contribute to answering these questions, we recorded blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals from 10 stroke survivors and evaluated dynamical causal modeling (DCM)-based effective connectivity among three motor areas: primary motor cortex (M1), pre-motor cortex (PMC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), during motor-imagery and motor-execution tasks. We compared the connectivity between affected and unaffected hemispheres before and after mental practice and combined mental practice and physical therapy as treatments. The treatment (intervention) period varied in length between 14 to 51 days but all patients received the same dose of 60 h of treatment. Using Bayesian model selection (BMS) approach in the DCM approach, we found that, after intervention, the same network dominated during motor-imagery and motor-execution tasks but modulatory parameters suggested a suppressive influence of SM A on M1 during the motor-imagery task whereas the influence of SM A on M1 was unrestricted during the motor-execution task. We found that the intervention caused a reorganization of the network during both tasks for unaffected as well as for the affected hemisphere. Using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, we found that the intervention improved the regional connectivity among the motor areas during both the tasks. The connectivity between PMC and M1 was stronger in motor-imagery tasks whereas the connectivity from PMC to M1, SM A to M1 dominated in motor-execution tasks. There was significant behavioral improvement (p = 0.001) in sensation and motor movements because of the intervention as reflected by behavioral Fugl-Meyer (FMA) measures, which were significantly correlated (p = 0.05) with a subset of connectivity. These findings suggest that PMC and M1 play a crucial role during motor-imagery as well as during motor-execution task. In addition, M1 causes more exchange of causal information among motor areas during a motor-execution task than during a motor-imagery task due to its interaction with SM A. This study expands our understanding of motor network involved during two different tasks, which are commonly used during rehabilitation following stroke. A clear understanding of the effective connectivity networks leads to a better treatment in helping stroke survivors regain motor ability.},

In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we used single-trial classification to perform a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of categorical representation of objects in human visual cortex. Brain responses were recorded while participants viewed a set of 72 photographs of objects with a planned category structure. The Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) used for RSA was derived from confusions of a linear classifier operating on single EEG trials. In contrast to past studies, which used pairwise correlation or classification to derive the RDM, we used confusion matrices from multi-class classifications, which provided novel self-similarity measures that were used to derive the overall size of the representational space. We additionally performed classifications on subsets of the brain response in order to identify spatial and temporal EEG components that best discriminated object categories and exemplars. Results from category-level classifications revealed that brain responses to images of human faces formed the most distinct category, while responses to images from the two inanimate categories formed a single category cluster. Exemplar-level classifications produced a broadly similar category structure, as well as sub-clusters corresponding to natural language categories. Spatiotemporal components of the brain response that differentiated exemplars within a category were found to differ from those implicated in differentiating between categories. Our results show that a classification approach can be successfully applied to single-trial scalp-recorded EEG to recover fine-grained object category structure, as well as to identify interpretable spatiotemporal components underlying object processing. Finally, object category can be decoded from purely temporal information recorded at single electrodes.},

	abstract = {Statistical parametric maps are spatially extended statistical processes that are used to test hypotheses about regionally specific effects in neuroimaging data. The most established sorts of statistical parametric maps (e.g., Friston et al. [1991]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 11:690–699; Worsley et al. [1992]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 12:900–918) are based on linear models, for example ANCOVA, correlation coefficients and t tests. In the sense that these examples are all special cases of the general linear model it should be possible to implement them (and many others) within a unified framework. We present here a general approach that accomodates most forms of experimental layout and ensuing analysis (designed experiments with fixed effects for factors, covariates and interaction of factors). This approach brings together two well established bodies of theory (the general linear model and the theory of Gaussian fields) to provide a complete and simple framework for the analysis of imaging data. The importance of this framework is twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity, in that the same small number of operational equations is used irrespective of the complexity of the experiment or nature of the statistical model and (ii) the generality of the framework provides for great latitude in experimental design and analysis. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Multidomain instrumental evaluation of post-stroke chronic patients, coupled with standard clinical assessments, has rarely been exploited in the literature. Such an approach may be valuable to provide comprehensive insight regarding patients’ status, as well as orienting the rehabilitation therapies. Therefore, we propose a multidomain analysis including clinically compliant methods as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), kinematics, and clinical scales. The framework of upper-limb robot-assisted rehabilitation is selected as a challenging and promising scenario to test the multi-parameter evaluation, with the aim to assess whether and in which domains modifications may take place. Instrumental recordings and clinical scales were administered before and after a month of intensive robotic therapy of the impaired upper limb, on five post-stroke chronic hemiparetic patients. After therapy, all patients showed clinical improvement and presented pre/post modifications in one or several of the other domains as well. All patients performed the motor task in a smoother way; two of them appeared to change their muscle synergies activation strategies, and most subjects showed variations in their brain activity, both in the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres. Changes highlighted by the new multiparametric instrumental approach suggest a recovery trend in agreement with clinical scales. In addition, by jointly demonstrating lateralization of brain activations, changes in muscle recruitment and the execution of smoother trajectories, the new approach may help distinguish between true functional recovery and the adoption of suboptimal compensatory strategies. In the light of these premises, the multi-domain approach may allow a finer patient characterization, providing a deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying the relearning procedure and the level (neuro/muscular) at which it occurred, at a relatively low expenditure. The role of this quantitative description in defining a personalized treatment strategy is of great interest and should be addressed in future studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Recovery from a stroke is a dynamic time-dependent process, in which the central nervous system reorganises to accommodate for the impact of the injury. The purpose of this paper is to review recent longitudinal studies of changes in brain connectivity after stroke. A systematic review of research papers reporting functional or effective connectivity at two or more time points in stroke patients was conducted. Stroke leads to an early reduction of connectivity in the motor network. With recovery time, the connectivity increases and can reach the same levels as in healthy participants. The increase in connectivity is correlated with functional motor gains. A new, more randomised pattern of connectivity may then emerge in the longer term. In some instances, a pattern of increased connectivity even higher than in healthy controls can be observed, and is related either to a specific time point or to a specific neural structure. Rehabilitation interventions can help improve connectivity between specific regions. Moreover, motor network connectivity undergoes reorganisation during recovery from a stroke and can be related to behavioural recovery. A detailed analysis of changes in connectivity pattern may enable a better understanding of adaptation to a stroke and how compensatory mechanisms in the brain may be supported by rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: For more than 20 years, Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD), as a nonlinear method, has occupied an important place in the analysis of biological signals. The use of HFD has evolved from EEG and single neuron activity analysis to the most recent application in automated assessments of different clinical conditions. Our objective is to provide an updated review of the HFD method applied in basic and clinical neurophysiological research. Methods: This article summarizes and critically reviews a broad literature and major findings concerning the applications of HFD for measuring the complexity of neuronal activity during different neurophysiological conditions. The source of information used in this review comes from the PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore Digital Library databases. Results: The review process substantiated the significance, advantages and shortcomings of HFD application within all key areas of basic and clinical neurophysiology. Therefore, the paper discusses HFD application alone, combined with other linear or nonlinear measures, or as a part of automated methods for analyzing neurophysiological signals. Conclusions: The speed, accuracy and cost of applying the HFD method for research and medical diagnosis make it stand out from the widely used linear methods. However, only a combination of HFD with other nonlinear methods ensures reliable and accurate analysis of a wide range of neurophysiological signals.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In recent years, robotic training has been utilized for recovery of motor control in patients with motor deficits. Along with clinical assessment, electrical patterns in the brain have emerged as a marker for studying changes in the brain associated with brain injury and rehabilitation. These changes mainly involve an imbalance between the two hemispheres. We aimed to study the effect of brain computer interface (BCI)-based robotic hand training on stroke subjects using clinical assessment, electroencephalographic (EEG) complexity analysis, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity analysis. Method: Resting-state simultaneous EEG-fMRI was conducted on 14 stroke subjects before and after training who underwent 20 sessions robot hand training. Fractal dimension (FD) analysis was used to assess neuronal impairment and functional recovery using the EEG data, and fMRI connectivity analysis was performed to assess changes in the connectivity of brain networks. Results: FD results indicated a significant asymmetric difference between the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres before training, which was reduced after robotic hand training. Moreover, a positive correlation between interhemispheric asymmetry change for central brain region and change in Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMA) scores for upper limb was observed. Connectivity results showed a significant difference between pre-training interhemispheric connectivity and post-training interhemispheric connectivity. Moreover, the change in connectivity correlated with the change in FMA scores. Results also indicated a correlation between the increase in connectivity for motor regions and decrease in FD interhemispheric asymmetry for central brain region covering the motor area. Conclusion: In conclusion, robotic hand training significantly facilitated stroke motor recovery, and FD, along with connectivity analysis can detect neuroplasticity changes.},

Here, we evaluated the neurophysiological effectiveness of direct brain control of robotic exoskeleton that provides movement support contingent with brain activity. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neurofeedback intervention, we assessed resting-state functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI) between the ipsilesional sensory and motor cortices before and after a single 1-h intervention. Eighteen stroke patients were randomly assigned to crossover interventions in a double-blind and sham-controlled design. One patient dropped out midway through the study, and 17 patients were included in this analysis. Interventions involved motor imagery, robotic assistance, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation administered to a paretic finger. The neurofeedback intervention delivered stimulations contingent on desynchronized ipsilesional electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations during imagined movement, and the control intervention delivered sensorimotor stimulations that were independent of EEG oscillations. There was a significant time × intervention interaction in rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex. Post-hoc analysis showed a larger gain in increased functional connectivity during the neurofeedback intervention. Although the neurofeedback intervention delivered fewer total sensorimotor stimulations compared to the sham-control, rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices was increased during the neurofeedback intervention compared to the sham-control. Higher coactivation of the sensory and motor cortices during neurofeedback intervention enhanced rsfcMRI in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices. This study showed neurophysiological evidence that EEG-contingent neurofeedback is a promising strategy to induce intrinsic ipsilesional sensorimotor reorganization, supporting the importance of integrating closed-loop sensorimotor processing at a neurophysiological level.},

Passive robot-generated arm movements in conjunction with proprioceptive decision making and feedback modulate functional connectivity (FC) in sensory motor networks and improve sensorimotor adaptation in normal individuals. This proof-of-principle study investigates whether these effects can be observed in stroke patients. Methods. A total of 10 chronic stroke patients with a range of stable motor and sensory deficits (Fugl-Meyer Arm score [FMA] 0-65, Nottingham Sensory Assessment [NSA] 10-40) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after a single session of robot-controlled proprioceptive training with feedback. Changes in FC were identified in each patient using independent component analysis as well as a seed region–based approach. FC changes were related to impairment and changes in task performance were assessed. Results. A single training session improved average arm reaching accuracy in 6 and proprioception in 8 patients. Two networks showing training-associated FC change were identified. Network C1 was present in all patients and network C2 only in patients with FM scores {\textgreater}7. Relatively larger C1 volume in the ipsilesional hemisphere was associated with less impairment (r = 0.83 for NSA, r = 0.73 for FMA). This association was driven by specific regions in the contralesional hemisphere and their functional connections (supramarginal gyrus with FM scores r = 0.82, S1 with NSA scores r = 0.70, and cerebellum with NSA score r = −0.82). Conclusion. A single session of robot-controlled proprioceptive training with feedback improved movement accuracy and induced FC changes in sensory motor networks of chronic stroke patients. FC changes are related to functional impairment and comprise bilateral sensory and motor network nodes.},

	abstract = {Background: One of the current challenges in brain-machine interfacing is to characterize and decode upper limb kinematics from brain signals, e.g. to control a prosthetic device. Recent research work states that it is possible to do so based on low frequency EEG components. However, the validity of these results is still a matter of discussion. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of decoding upper limb kinematics from EEG signals in center-out reaching tasks during passive and active movements. Methods: The decoding of arm movement was performed using a multidimensional linear regression. Passive movements were analyzed using the same methodology to study the influence of proprioceptive sensory feedback in the decoding. Finally, we evaluated the possible advantages of classifying reaching targets, instead of continuous trajectories. Results: The results showed that arm movement decoding was significantly above chance levels. The results also indicated that EEG slow cortical potentials carry significant information to decode active center-out movements. The classification of reached targets allowed obtaining the same conclusions with a very high accuracy. Additionally, the low decoding performance obtained from passive movements suggests that discriminant modulations of low-frequency neural activity are mainly related to the execution of movement while proprioceptive feedback is not sufficient to decode upper limb kinematics. Conclusions: This paper contributes to the assessment of feasibility of using linear regression methods to decode upper limb kinematics from EEG signals. From our findings, it can be concluded that low frequency bands concentrate most of the information extracted from upper limb kinematics decoding and that decoding performance of active movements is above chance levels and mainly related to the activation of cortical motor areas. We also show that the classification of reached targets from decoding approaches may be a more suitable real-time methodology than a direct decoding of hand position.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle activity is continuously modulated across physiologic states to provide coordination, flexibility and responsiveness to body tasks and external inputs. Despite the central role the muscular system plays in facilitating vital body functions, the network of brain-muscle interactions required to control hundreds of muscles and synchronize their activation in relation to distinct physiologic states has not been investigated. Recent approaches have focused on general associations between individual brain rhythms and muscle activation during movement tasks. However, the specific forms of coupling, the functional network of cortico-muscular coordination, and how network structure and dynamics are modulated by autonomic regulation across physiologic states remains unknown. To identify and quantify the cortico-muscular interaction network and uncover basic features of neuro-autonomic control of muscle function, we investigate the coupling between synchronous bursts in cortical rhythms and peripheral muscle activation during sleep and wake. Utilizing the concept of time delay stability and a novel network physiology approach, we find that the brain-muscle network exhibits complex dynamic patterns of communication involving multiple brain rhythms across cortical locations and different electromyographic frequency bands. Moreover, our results show that during each physiologic state the cortico-muscular network is characterized by a specific profile of network links strength, where particular brain rhythms play role of main mediators of interaction and control. Further, we discover a hierarchical reorganization in network structure across physiologic states, with high connectivity and network link strength during wake, intermediate during REM and light sleep, and low during deep sleep, a sleep-stage stratification that demonstrates a unique association between physiologic states and cortico-muscular network structure. The reported empirical observations are consistent across individual subjects, indicating universal behavior in network structure and dynamics, and high sensitivity of cortico-muscular control to changes in autonomic regulation, even at low levels of physical activity and muscle tone during sleep. Our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized basic principles of brain-muscle network communication and control, and provide new perspectives on the regulatory mechanisms of brain dynamics and locomotor activation, with potential clinical implications for neurodegenerative, movement and sleep disorders, and for developing efficient treatment strategies.},

We measured whole brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals and extracted source signals in 24 motor-related areas. Functional connectivity and centralities were calculated according to time flow. Our results showed that brain networks differed between states of motor planning and movement. Connectivities between most motor-related areas were increased in the motor-planning state. In contrast, only connectivities with cerebellum and basal ganglia were increased while those of other motor-related areas were decreased during movement. Our results indicate that most processes involved in motor control are completed before movement. Further, brain developed network related to feedback rather than motor decision during movements. Our findings also suggest that neural signals during motor planning might be more predictive than neural signals during movement. They facilitate accurate prediction of movement for brain-machine interfaces and provide insight into brain mechanisms in motor control.},

The goal of this study was to quantify differences in group-level corticomuscular connectivity responses to sensorimotor perturbations during walking and standing. We hypothesized that perturbed visual input during balance would transiently decrease connectivity between occipital and parietal areas due to disruptive visual input during sensory processing. We also hypothesized that physical pull perturbations would increase cortical connections to central sensorimotor areas because of higher sensorimotor integration demands. Our findings show decreased occipito-parietal connectivity during visual rotations and widespread increases in connectivity during pull perturbations focused on central areas, as expected. We also found evidence for communication from cortex to muscles during perturbed balance. These results show that sensorimotor perturbations to balance alter cortical networks and can be quantified using effective connectivity estimation.},

There is increasing evidence that the brain tries to reorganize itself and to replace the damaged circuits, by establishing compensatory pathways. Intra- and extra-cellular currents are involved in the communication between neurons and the macroscopic effects of such currents can be detected at the scalp through electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors. EEG can be used to study the lesions in the brain indirectly, by studying their effects on the brain electrical activity. The primary goal of the present work was to investigate possible asymmetries in the activity of the two hemispheres, in the case one of them is affected by a lesion due to stroke. In particular, the compressibility of High-Density-EEG (HD-EEG) recorded at the two hemispheres was investigated since the presence of the lesion is expected to impact on the regularity of EEG signals. The secondary objective was to evaluate if standard low density EEG is able to provide such information. Eighteen patients with unilateral stroke were recruited and underwent HD-EEG recording. Each EEG signal was compressively sensed, using Block Sparse Bayesian Learning, at increasing compression rate. The two hemispheres showed significant differences in the compressibility of EEG. Signals acquired at the electrode locations of the affected hemisphere showed a better reconstruction quality, quantified by the Structural SIMilarity index (SSIM), than the EEG signals recorded at the healthy hemisphere (p {\textless} 0.05), for each compression rate value. The presence of the lesion seems to induce an increased regularity in the electrical activity of the brain, thus an increased compressibility.},

	abstract = {In neuromotor control, the dimensionality of complex muscular activation patterns is effectively reduced through the emergence of muscle synergies. Muscle synergies are tailored to task-specific biomechanical needs. Traditionally, they are considered as low-dimensional neural output of the spinal cord and as such their coherent cortico-muscular pathways have remained underexplored in humans. We investigated whether muscle synergies have a higher-order origin, especially, whether they are manifest in the cortical motor network. We focused on cortical muscle synergy representations involved in balance control and examined changes in cortico-synergy coherence accompanying short-term balance training. We acquired electromyography and electro-encephalography and reconstructed cortical source activity using adaptive spatial filters. The latter were based on three muscle synergies decomposed from the activity of nine unilateral leg muscles using non-negative matrix factorization. The corresponding cortico-synergy coherence displayed phase-locked activity at the Piper rhythm, i.e., cortico-spinal synchronization around 40 Hz. Our study revealed the presence of muscle synergies in the motor cortex, in particular, in the paracentral lobule, known for the representation of lower extremities. We conclude that neural oscillations synchronize between the motor cortex and spinal motor neuron pools signifying muscle synergies. The corresponding cortico-synergy coherence around the Piper rhythm decreases with training-induced balance improvement.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) directly reflects functioning of brain synapses with a uniquely high temporal resolution, necessary for investigation of brain network dynamics. Since synaptic dysfunction is an early event and best correlate of cognitive status and decline in patients along Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, EEG microstates might serve as valuable early markers of AD. The present study investigated differences in EEG microstate topographies and parameters (duration, occurrence and contribution) between a large cohort of healthy elderly (n = 308) and memory clinic patients: subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 210); mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 230) and AD (n = 197) and how they correlate to conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD. Four most representative microstate maps assigned as classes A, B (asymmetrical), C and D (symmetrical) were computed from the resting state EEGs since it has been shown previously that this is sufficient to explain most of the resting state EEG data. Statistically different topography of microstate maps were found between the controls and the patient groups for microstate classes A, C and D. Changes in the topography of microstate class C were associated with the CSF Aβ42 levels, whereas changes in the topography of class B were linked with the CSF p-tau levels. Gradient-like increase in the contribution of asymmetrical (A and B) and gradient-like decrease in the contribution of symmetrical (C and D) maps were observed with the more severe stage of cognitive impairment. Our study demonstrated extensive relationship of resting state EEG microstates topographies and parameters with the stage of cognitive impairment and AD biomarkers. Resting state EEG microstates might therefore serve as functional markers of early disruption of neurocognitive networks in patients along AD continuum.},

The dynamics of two of the four canonical classes of microstates, commonly labeled as C and D, have been suggested as a potential endophenotype for schizophrenia. For endophenotypes, unaffected relatives of patients must show abnormalities compared to controls. Here, we examined microstate dynamics in resting-state recordings of unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia, patients with schizophrenia, healthy controls, and patients with first episodes of psychosis (FEP). Patients with schizophrenia and their siblings showed increased presence of microstate class C and decreased presence of microstate class D compared to controls. No difference was found between FEP and chronic patients. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of microstate classes C and D are a candidate endophenotype for schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Stroke has long been regarded as focal disease with circumscribed damage leading to neurological deficits. However, advances in methods for assessing the human brain and in statistics have enabled new tools for the examination of the consequences of stroke on brain structure and function. Thereby, it has become evident that stroke has impact on the entire brain and its network properties and can therefore be considered as a network disease. The present review first gives an overview of current methodological opportunities and pitfalls for assessing stroke-induced changes and reorganization in the human brain. We then summarize principles of plasticity after stroke that have emerged from the assessment of networks. Thereby, it is shown that neurological deficits do not only arise from focal tissue damage but also from local and remote changes in white-matter tracts and in neural interactions among wide-spread networks. Similarly, plasticity and clinical improvements are associated with specific compensatory structural and functional patterns of neural network interactions. Innovative treatment approaches have started to target such network patterns to enhance recovery. Network assessments to predict treatment response and to individualize rehabilitation is a promising way to enhance specific treatment effects and overall outcome after stroke.},

First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the reader to simulate each of these potential problems.

	abstract = {Background: Electroencephalographic data are easily contaminated by signals of non-neural origin. Independent component analysis (ICA) can help correct EEG data for such artifacts. Artifact independent components (ICs) can be identified by experts via visual inspection. But artifact features are sometimes ambiguous or difficult to notice, and even experts may disagree about how to categorise a particular component. It is therefore important to inform users on artifact properties, and give them the opportunity to intervene. New Method: Here we first describe artifacts captured by ICA. We review current methods to automatically select artifactual components for rejection, and introduce the SASICA software, implementing several novel selection algorithms as well as two previously described automated methods (ADJUST, Mognon et al. Psychophysiology 2011;48(2):229; and FASTER, Nolan et al. J Neurosci Methods 2010;48(1):152). Results: We evaluate these algorithms by comparing selections suggested by SASICA and other methods to manual rejections by experts. The results show that these methods can inform observers to improve rejections. However, no automated method can accurately isolate artifacts without supervision. The comprehensive and interactive plots produced by SASICA therefore constitute a helpful guide for human users for making final decisions. Conclusions: Rejecting ICs before EEG data analysis unavoidably requires some level of supervision. SASICA offers observers detailed information to guide selection of artifact ICs. Because it uses quantitative parameters and thresholds, it improves objectivity and reproducibility in reporting pre-processing procedures. SASICA is also a didactic tool that allows users to quickly understand what signal features captured by ICs make them likely to reflect artifacts.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - Low-frequency oscillations reflect brain injury but also contribute to normal behaviors. We examined hypotheses relating electroencephalography measures, including low-frequency oscillations, to injury and motor recovery poststroke. Methods - Patients with stroke completed structural neuroimaging, a resting-state electroencephalography recording and clinical testing. A subset admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility also underwent serial electroencephalography recordings. The relationship that electroencephalography measures (power and coherence with leads overlying ipsilesional primary motor cortex [iM1]) had with injury and motor status was assessed, focusing on delta (1-3 Hz) and high-beta (20-30 Hz) bands. Results - Across all patients (n=62), larger infarct volume was related to higher delta band power in bilateral hemispheres and to higher delta band coherence between iM1 and bilateral regions. In chronic stroke, higher delta power bilaterally correlated with better motor status. In subacute stroke, higher delta coherence between iM1 and bilateral areas correlated with poorer motor status. These coherence findings were confirmed in serial recordings from 18 patients in an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Here, interhemispheric coherence between leads overlying iM1 and contralesional M1 was elevated at inpatient rehabilitation facility admission compared with healthy controls (n=22), declining to control levels over time. Decreases in interhemispheric coherence between iM1 and contralesional M1 correlated with better motor recovery. Conclusions - Delta band coherence with iM1 related to greater injury and poorer motor status subacutely, while delta band power related to greater injury and better motor status chronically. Low-frequency oscillations reflect both injury and recovery after stroke and may be useful biomarkers in stroke recovery and rehabilitation.},

We propose a Bayesian approach that directly models the posterior distribution of lesion-proportion difference, and makes decisions based on inference on this posterior distribution. Compared to NHST-based approaches, our Bayesian approach yields inference results with clearer semantics, and does not require multiple-comparison correction. We evaluated our Bayesian method using simulated data, and data from a study of acute ischemic left-hemispheric stroke.

With recent advances in brain imaging and image processing, LSM has become a popular tool in cognitive neuroscience. LSM can provide fundamental insights into the functional architecture of the human brain for a variety of cognitive and non-cognitive functions. A crucial step in performing LSM studies is the segmentation of lesions on brains scans of a large group of patients and registration of each scan to a common stereotaxic space (also called standard space or a standardized brain template). Described here is an open-access, standardized method for infarct segmentation and registration for the purpose of LSM, as well as a detailed and hands-on walkthrough based on exemplary cases. A comprehensive tutorial for the manual segmentation of brain infarcts on CT scans and DWI or FLAIR MRI sequences is provided, including criteria for infarct identification and pitfalls for different scan types. The registration software provides multiple registration schemes that can be used for processing of CT and MRI data with heterogeneous acquisition parameters. A tutorial on using this registration software and performing visual quality checks and manual corrections (which are needed in some cases) is provided. This approach provides researchers with a framework for the entire process of brain image processing required to perform an LSM study, from gathering of the data to final quality checks of the results.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) of brain activity can be represented in terms of dynamically changing topographies (microstates). Notably, spontaneous brain activity recorded at rest can be characterized by four distinctive topographies. Despite their well-established role during resting state, their implication in the generation of motor behavior is debated. Evidence of such a functional role of spontaneous brain activity would provide support for the design of novel and sensitive biomarkers in neurological disorders. Here we examined whether and to what extent intrinsic brain activity contributes and plays a functional role during natural motor behaviors. For this we first extracted subject-specific EEG microstates and muscle synergies during reaching-And-grasping movements in healthy volunteers. We show that, in every subject, well-known resting-state microstates persist during movement execution with similar topographies and temporal characteristics, but are supplemented by novel task-related microstates. We then show that the subject-specific microstates' dynamical organization correlates with the activation of muscle synergies and can be used to decode individual grasping movements with high accuracy. These findings provide first evidence that spontaneous brain activity encodes detailed information about motor control, offering as such the prospect of a novel tool for the definition of subject-specific biomarkers of brain plasticity and recovery in neuro-motor disorders.},

	abstract = {Computed tomographic (CT) images are widely used for the identification of abnormal brain tissue following infarct and hemorrhage in stroke. Manual lesion delineation is currently the standard approach, but is both time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address these issues, we present a method that can automatically delineate infarct and hemorrhage in stroke CT images. The key elements of this method are the accurate normalization of CT images from stroke patients into template space and the subsequent voxelwise comparison with a group of control CT images for defining areas with hypo- or hyper-intense signals. Our validation, using simulated and actual lesions, shows that our approach is effective in reconstructing lesions resulting from both infarct and hemorrhage and yields lesion maps spatially consistent with those produced manually by expert operators. A limitation is that, relative to manual delineation, there is reduced sensitivity of the automated method in regions close to the ventricles and the brain contours. However, the automated method presents a number of benefits in terms of offering significant time savings and the elimination of the inter-operator differences inherent to manual tracing approaches. These factors are relevant for the creation of large-scale lesion databases for neuropsychological research. The automated delineation of stroke lesions from CT scans may also enable longitudinal studies to quantify changes in damaged tissue in an objective and reproducible manner. © 2014 The Authors.},

The most popular standard templates are derived from MRI scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we developed a CT template: while this is the dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern CT templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize CT scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65. years old). This template allows studies where only CT scans are available. Second, we derived a MRI template that approximately matches the shape of our CT template as well as processing steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present.

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are among the most important techniques for non-invasively studying cognition and disease in the human brain. These signals are known to originate from cortical neural activity, typically described in terms of current dipoles. While the link between cortical current dipoles and EEG/MEG signals is relatively well understood, surprisingly little is known about the link between different kinds of neural activity and the current dipoles themselves. Detailed biophysical modeling has played an important role in exploring the neural origin of intracranial electric signals, like extracellular spikes and local field potentials. However , this approach has not yet been taken full advantage of in the context of exploring the neural origin of the cortical current dipoles that are causing EEG/MEG signals. Here, we present a method for reducing arbitrary simulated neural activity to single current dipoles. We find that the method is applicable for calculating extracranial signals, but less suited for calculating intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) signals. We demonstrate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for investigating the neural origin of EEG/MEG signals. This is done through example studies of the single-neuron EEG contribution, the putative EEG contribution from calcium spikes, and from calculating EEG signals from large-scale neural network simulations. We also demonstrate how the simulated current dipoles can be used directly in combination with detailed head models, allowing for simulated EEG signals with an unprecedented level of biophysical details. In conclusion, this paper presents a framework for biophysically detailed modeling of EEG and MEG signals, which can be used to better our understanding of non-inasively measured neural activity in humans.

By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts in to the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline(PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets.

	abstract = {Objective: Recent work has attempted to clarify the energetics of physiological responding and behaviour by refining and separating the operational definitions of "arousal" and "activation", which have different effects on physiological responding and behaviour. At the EEG level, we relate the former to widespread activity, and the latter to task-specific topographically-focussed activity reflecting regional processing. This study aimed to investigate this further in terms of differences in EEG activity between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions. Methods: EEG activity was recorded from 28 university students during both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, Fourier transformed to provide estimates for absolute power in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands, and analysed in 9 regions across the scalp. Skin conductance level was also measured as an indicator of arousal level. Results: Across the eyes-closed conditions, skin conductance levels were negatively correlated with mean alpha levels. Skin conductance levels increased significantly from eyes-closed to eyes-open conditions. Reductions were found in across-scalp mean absolute delta, theta, alpha and beta from the eyes-closed to eyes-open condition. Topographic changes were also evident in all bands except for alpha, with reduced lateral frontal delta and posterior theta, and decreased posterior/increased frontal beta in the eyes-open condition. In particular, the topographic beta effects indicate that the across-scalp reduction arose from focal reductions rather than global changes. Conclusions: The obtained results confirm the use of mean alpha level as a measure of resting-state arousal under eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. The focal nature of EEG effects in the other bands suggests that these reflect cortical processing of visual input, producing differences in activation between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, rather than just the simple increase in arousal level shown in alpha. Significance: This study demonstrates that the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions provide EEG measures differing in topography as well as power levels. These differences should be recognised when evaluating EEG research, and considered when choosing eyes-open or eyes-closed baseline conditions for different paradigms. © 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

SCD could also be related to other conditions such as normal aging, psychiatric, neurological or medical disorders. The SCD Initiative proposed a set of features (SCD-plus) that increase the likelihood of preclinical AD in individuals with SCD. Our aim was to assess the effect of these features on the risk of conversion from SCD to AD. Methods: In total 150 SCD subjects who underwent extensive neuropsychological investigation, assessment of cognitive complaints and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping at baseline and clinical-neuropsychological follow-up for a mean time of 11 years were included. Results: During the follow-up, 20 subjects developed AD. Considering SCD-plus features, age at onset ≥60 years and ApoE ε4 significantly increased the risk of conversion from SCD to AD. When our sample was stratified into three groups (no risk factor, one risk factor, two risk factors), the proportion of conversion was statistically significantly different between the three groups. Conclusions: Our model allows the risk of AD to be stratified in patients experiencing SCD according to age at onset and ApoE genotype.},

	abstract = {Band ratio measures, computed as the ratio of power between two frequency bands, are a common analysis measure in neuro-electrophysiological recordings. Band ratio measures are typically interpreted as reflecting quantitative measures of periodic, or oscillatory, activity. This assumes that the measure reflects relative powers of distinct periodic components that are well captured by predefined frequency ranges. However, electrophysiological signals contain periodic components and a 1/f-like aperiodic component, the latter of which contributes power across all frequencies. Here, we investigate whether band ratio measures truly reflect oscillatory power differences, and/or to what extent ratios may instead reflect other periodic changes—such as in center frequency or bandwidth—and/or aperiodic activity. In simulation, we investigate how band ratio measures relate to changes in multiple spectral features, and show how multiple periodic and aperiodic features influence band ratio measures. We validate these findings in human electroencephalography (EEG) data, comparing band ratio measures to parameterizations of power spectral features, and find that multiple disparate features influence ratio measures. For example, the commonly applied theta/beta ratio is most reflective of differences in aperiodic activity, and not oscillatory theta or beta power. Collectively, we show that periodic and aperiodic features can create the same observed changes in band ratio measures, and that this is inconsistent with their typical interpretations as measures of periodic power. We conclude that band ratio measures are a non-specific measure, conflating multiple possible underlying spectral changes, and recommend explicit parameterization of neural power spectra as a more specific approach. Significance Statement Neural oscillations are a ubiquitous feature of investigation in electrophysiological recordings. Frequency band ratio measures are a common approach to investigate neural oscillations, applied across cognitive and clinical neuroscience, and in recording modalities such as in electroencephalography and local field potentials. In this work we systematically investigate the methodological properties of band ratio measures. We show that band ratio measures are not specific to measuring oscillatory power, as they are intended and interpreted to do. Rather, they often reflect other features of the data, such as aperiodic, or 1/f-like, activity. These findings are significant for interpreting prior empirical and clinical research, guiding future work, and another motivation that aperiodic neural activity should be a key consideration when studying electrophysiological data.},

	abstract = {Surface EEG (Electroencephalography) signal is vulnerable to interference due to its characteristics and sampling methods. So it is of great importance to evaluate the collected EEG signal prior to use. Traditional methods usually use the impedance between skin and electrode to estimate the quality of the EEG signal, which has shortcomings such as monotonous features, high false positive rates, and poor real-time capability. Aiming at addressing these issues, this paper presents a novel model of EEG quality assessment based on Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method. The developed model employs amplitude, power frequency ratio, and alpha band PSD (Power Spectral Density) ratio of resting EEG signal as evaluation factors, and performs a quantitative assessment of the signal quality. Experiments show that the proposed model can significantly determine the EEG signal quality. In addition, the model is simple in implementation with low computational complexity, and is able to present the EEG quality evaluation results in real time. Before the formal measurement, collecting short-term resting EEG data, and evaluating the EEG signal quality and current signal acquisition environment using the model, the collection efficiency of qualified EEG signals can be greatly improved.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have been rarely included in large-scale studies. This is arguably not due to a lack of information that lies in EEG recordings but mainly on account of methodological issues. In many cases, particularly in clinical, pediatric and aging populations, the EEG has a high degree of artifact contamination and the quality of EEG recordings often substantially differs between subjects. Although there exists a variety of standardized preprocessing methods to clean EEG from artifacts, currently there is no method to objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG. This makes the commonly accepted procedure of excluding subjects from analyses due to exceeding contamination of artifacts highly subjective. As a consequence, P-hacking is fostered, the replicability of results is decreased, and it is difficult to pool data from different study sites. In addition, in large-scale studies, data are collected over years or even decades, requiring software that controls and manages the preprocessing of ongoing and dynamically growing studies. To address these challenges, we developed Automagic, an open-source MATLAB toolbox that acts as a wrapper to run currently available preprocessing methods and offers objective standardized quality assessment for growing studies. The software is compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard and hence facilitates data sharing. In the present paper we outline the functionality of Automagic and examine the effect of applying combinations of methods on a sample of resting and task-based EEG data. This examination suggests that applying a pipeline of algorithms to detect artifactual channels in combination with Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), an independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction method, is sufficient to reduce a large extent of artifacts.},

	abstract = {Background: Impairments in biomechanics and neural control can disrupt the timing and muscle pattern activation necessary for smooth gait. Gait is one of the most affected motor characteristics in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its smoothness has not been well-studied. This work applies the recently proposed spectral arc length measure (SPARC) to study, for the first time, gait in patients with PD. We hypothesized that the gait of patients with PD would be less smooth than that of healthy controls, as reflected in the SPARC measures. Methods: The gait of 101 PD patients and 39 healthy controls was assessed using an inertial sensor. Smoothness of gait was estimated with SPARC (respectively from acceleration and angular velocity signals, SPARC-Acc and SPARC-Gyro) and harmonic ratios. Correlations between SPARC, traditional gait measures and the motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were evaluated. Measurements and analysis were conducted with and without anti-PD medication. Results: SPARC measures were lower (less smooth) in PD than in controls (SPARC-Acc: PD: - 6.11 ± 0.74; CO: -5.17 ± 0.79; p {\textless} 0.001). When comparing PD to controls, SPARC-Acc differed more than other measures of gait (i.e., largest effect size, which was {\textgreater} 1). SPARC measures were correlated with UPDRS motor score (r = - 0.65), while they were independent of other measures of gait smoothness. PD gait in the on state was smoother than in the off state (p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: SPARC calculated from trunk acceleration and angular velocity signals provide valid measures of walking smoothness in PD. SPARC is sensitive to Parkinson's disease and PD medications and can be used of as another, complementary measure of the motor control of walking in PD.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier.

These functional microstates are thought to be the building blocks of spontaneous consciousness. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a useful tool for imaging microstates, and EEG microstate analysis can potentially give insight into altered brain dynamics underpinning cognitive impairment in disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Since EEG is non-invasive and relatively inexpensive, EEG microstates have the potential to be useful clinical tools for aiding early diagnosis of AD. In this study, EEG was collected from two independent cohorts of probable AD and cognitively healthy control participants, and a cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with four-year clinical follow-up. The microstate associated with the frontoparietal working-memory/attention network was altered in AD due to parietal inactivation. Using a novel measure of complexity, we found microstate transitioning was slower and less complex in AD. When combined with a spectral EEG measure, microstate complexity could classify AD with sensitivity and specificity {\textgreater} 80\%, which was tested on an independent cohort, and could predict progression from MCI to AD in a small preliminary test cohort of 11 participants. EEG microstates therefore have potential to be a non-invasive functional biomarker of AD.},

	abstract = {A major prerequisite for successful rehabilitation therapy after stroke is the understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor deficits common to these patients. Studies have shown that in stroke patients multijoint pointing movements are characterized by decreased movement speed and increased movement variability, by increased movement segmentation and by spatial and temporal incoordination between adjacent arm joints with respect to healthy subjects. We studied how the damaged nervous system recovers or compensates for deficits in reaching, and correlated reaching deficits with the level of functional impairment. Nine right-hemiparetic subjects and nine healthy subjects participated. All subjects were right-hand dominant. Data from the affected arm of hemiparetic subjects were compared with those from the arm in healthy subjects. Seated subjects made 40 pointing movements with the right arm in a single session. Movements were made from an initial target, for which the arm was positioned alongside the trunk. Then the subject lifted the arm and pointed to the final target, located in front of the subject in the contralateral workspace. Kinematic data from the arm and trunk were recorded with a three-dimensional analysis system. Arm movements in stroke subjects were longer, more segmented, more variable and had larger movement errors. Elbow-shoulder coordination was disrupted and the range of active joint motion was decreased significantly compared with healthy subjects. Some aspects of motor performance (duration, segmentation, accuracy and coordination) were significantly correlated with the level of motor impairment. Despite the fact that stroke subjects encountered all these deficits, even subjects with the most severe motor impairment were able to transport the endpoint to the target. All but one subject involved the trunk to accomplish this motor task. In others words, they recruited new degrees of freedom typically not used by healthy subjects. The use of compensatory strategies may be related to the degree of motor impairment: severely to moderately impaired subjects recruited new degrees of freedom to compensate for motor deficits while mildly impaired subjects tended to employ healthy movement patterns. We discuss the possibility that there is a critical level of recovery at which patients switch from a strategy employing new degrees of freedom to one in which motor recovery is produced by improving the management of degrees of freedom characteristic of healthy performance. Our data also suggest that stroke subjects may be able to exploit effectively the redundancy of the motor system.},

Using 18 empirical and 18 modeled stroke networks, we also investigated the effect that focal lesions have on node entropy and information diffusion. Overall, positive correlations between node entropy and structure were observed, especially between node entropy and node strength in both empirical and modeled data. Although lesions were restricted to one hemisphere in all stroke patients, entropy reduction was not only present in nodes from the damaged hemisphere, but also in nodes from the contralesioned hemisphere, an effect replicated in modeled stroke networks. Globally, information diffusion was also affected in empirical and modeled strokes compared with healthy controls. This is the first study showing that artificial lesions affect local and global network aspects in very similar ways compared with empirical strokes, shedding new light into the functional nature of stroke.},

	title = {Motor learning: {Its} relevance to stroke recovery and neurorehabilitation},
	url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16415682/},
	abstract = {Purpose of review: Much of neurorehabilitation rests on the assumption that patients can improve with practice. This review will focus on arm movements and address the following questions: (i) What is motor learning? (ii) Do patients with hemiparesis have a learning deficit? (iii) Is recovery after injury a form of motor learning? (iv) Are approaches based on motor learning principles useful for rehabilitation? Recent findings: Motor learning can be broken into kinematic and dynamic components. Studies in healthy subjects suggest that retention of motor learning is best accomplished with variable training schedules. Animal models and functional imaging in humans show that the mature brain can undergo plastic changes during both learning and recovery. Quantitative motor control approaches allow differentiation between compensation and true recovery, although both improve with practice. Several promising new rehabilitation approaches are based on theories of motor learning. These include impairment oriented-training (IOT), constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), electromyogram (EMG)-triggered neuromuscular stimulation, robotic interactive therapy and virtual reality (VR). Summary: Motor learning mechanisms are operative during spontaneous stroke recovery and interact with rehabilitative training. For optimal results, rehabilitation tehniques should be geared towards patiens' specific motor deficits and possibly combined, for example, CIMT with VR. Two critical questions that should always be asked of a rehabilitation technique are whether they generalize to untrained tasks. © 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Background. Accurate prediction of clinical impairment in upper-extremity motor function following therapy in chronic stroke patients is a difficult task for clinicians but is key in prescribing appropriate therapeutic strategies. Machine learning is a highly promising avenue with which to improve prediction accuracy in clinical practice. Objectives. The objective was to evaluate the performance of 5 machine learning methods in predicting postintervention upper-extremity motor impairment in chronic stroke patients using demographic, clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging input variables. Methods. A total of 102 patients (female: 31\%, age 61 ± 11 years) were included. The upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FMA) was used to assess motor impairment of the upper limb before and after intervention. Elastic net (EN), support vector machines, artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, and random forest were used to predict postintervention UE-FMA. The performances of methods were compared using cross-validated R2. Results. EN performed significantly better than other methods in predicting postintervention UE-FMA using demographic and baseline clinical data (median (Formula presented.) P {\textless}.05). Preintervention UE-FMA and the difference in motor threshold (MT) between the affected and unaffected hemispheres were the strongest predictors. The difference in MT had greater importance than the absence or presence of a motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the affected hemisphere. Conclusion. Machine learning methods may enable clinicians to accurately predict a chronic stroke patient’s postintervention UE-FMA. Interhemispheric difference in the MT is an important predictor of chronic stroke patients’ response to therapy and, therefore, could be included in prospective studies.},

	abstract = {Background. There is growing interest to establish recovery biomarkers, especially neurological biomarkers, in order to develop new therapies and prediction models for the promotion of stroke rehabilitation and recovery. However, there is no consensus among the neurorehabilitation community about which biomarker(s) have the highest predictive value for motor recovery. Objective. To review the evidence and determine which neurological biomarker(s) meet the high evidence quality criteria for use in predicting motor recovery. Methods. We searched databases for prognostic neuroimaging/neurophysiological studies. Methodological quality of each study was assessed using a previously employed comprehensive 15-item rating system. Furthermore, we used the GRADE approach and ranked the overall evidence quality for each category of neurologic biomarker. Results. Seventy-one articles met our inclusion criteria; 5 categories of neurologic biomarkers were identified: diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), conventional structural MRI (sMRI), and a combination of these biomarkers. Most studies were conducted with individuals after ischemic stroke in the acute and/or subacute stage (∼70\%). Less than one-third of the studies (21/71) were assessed with satisfactory methodological quality (80\% or more of total quality score). Conventional structural MRI and the combination biomarker categories ranked "high" in overall evidence quality. Conclusions. There were 3 prevalent methodological limitations: (a) lack of cross-validation, (b) lack of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for motor outcomes, and (c) small sample size. More high-quality studies are needed to establish which neurological biomarkers are the best predictors of motor recovery after stroke. Finally, the quarter-century old methodological quality tool used here should be updated by inclusion of more contemporary methods and statistical approaches.},

	abstract = {Strokes causing similar lesions and clinical states can be followed by diverse regains of neurological functions, indicating that the clinical recovery can depend on individual modulating factors. A promising line to disclose these factors, to finally open new therapeutic strategies, is to search for individual indices of recovery prognosis. Here, we pursued on strengthening the value of acute phase electrophysiological biomarkers for poststroke functional recovery in a wide group of patients. We enrolled 120 patients affected by a monohemispheric stroke within the middle cerebral artery territory (70 left and 50 right damages) and collected the NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score in the acute phase (T0, median 4 days) and chronic follow-up (T1, median 6 months). At T0, we executed electrophysiological noninvasive assessment (19-channel electroencephalography (EEG) or 28 channels per side magnetoencephalography (MEG)) of brain activity at rest by means of band powers in the contra- and ipsilesional hemispheres (CLH, ILH) or the homologous area symmetry (HArS). Low-band (2-6 Hz) HArS entered the regression model for predicting the stabilized clinical state (p{\textless}0.001), with bilateral impairment correlated with a poor outcome. Present data strengthen the fact that low-band impairment of homologous ipsi- and contralesional hemispheric regions in the acute stroke indicate a negative prognosis of clinical recovery.},

	abstract = {The identification of individual factors modulating clinical recovery after a stroke is fundamental to personalize the therapeutic intervention to enhance the final clinical outcome. In this framework, electrophysiological factors are promising since are more directly related to neuroplasticity, which supports recovery in stroke patients, than neurovascular factors. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated brain neuronal activity assessed via spectral features and Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD) of electroencephalographic signals in acute phase (2-10 days from symptom onset, T0) and sub-acute phase (2.5 months, T1) in 24 patients affected by unilateral middle cerebral artery stroke. Longitudinal assessment of the clinical deficits was performed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), together with the effective recovery calculated as the ratio between difference of NIHSS at T0 and T1 over the NIHSS value at T0. We observed that delta and alpha band electroencephalographic signal power changed between the two phases in both the hemispheres ipsilateral (ILH) and contralateral (CHL) to the lesion. Moreover, at T0, bilateral higher delta band power correlated with worse clinical conditions (Spearman's rs = 0.460, P = 0.027 for ILH and rs = 0.508, P = 0.013 for CLH), whereas at T1 this occurred only for delta power in ILH (rs = 0.411, P = 0.046) and not for CHL. Inter-hemispheric difference (ILH vs. CLH) of alpha power in patients was lower at T0 than at T1 (P = 0.020). HFD at T0 was lower than at T1 (P = 0.005), and at both phases, ILH HFD was lower than CLH HFD (P = 0.020). These data suggest that inter-hemispheric low band asymmetry and fractal dimension changes from the acute to the sub-acute phase are sensitive to neuroplasticity processes which subtend clinical recovery. The study protocol was approved by the Bioethical Committee of Ospedale San Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefretelli (No. 40/2011) on July 14, 2011.},

	abstract = {Cerebral post-stroke plasticity has been repeatedly investigated via functional neuroimaging techniques mainly based on blood flow/metabolism. However, little is known on predictive value of topological properties of widely distributed neural networks immediately following stroke on rehabilitation outcome and post-stroke recovery measured by early functional outcome. The utility of EEG network parameters (i.e. small world organization) analysis as a potential rough and simple biomarker for stroke outcome has been little explored and needs more validation. A total of 139 consecutive patients within a post-stroke acute stage underwent EEG recording. A group of 110 age paired healthy subjects constituted the control group. All patients were clinically evaluated with 3 scales for stroke: NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT. As a first result, NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT correlated with Small World index as provided by the proportional increment/decrement of low (delta) and viceversa of high (beta2 and gamma) EEG frequency bands. Furthermore, in line with the aim of the present study, we found a strong correlation between NIHSS at follow up and gamma Small World index in the acute post-stroke period, giving SW index a significant weight of recovery prediction. This study aimed to investigate possible correlations between functional abnormalities of brain networks, measured by small world characteristics detected in resting state EEG source investigation, and early post-stroke clinical outcome in order to find a possible predictive index of functional recovery to address and/or correct the rehabilitation program.},

Methods: Graph parameters of 41 consecutive stroke patients ({\textless}5 days from the event) were studied using eLORETA EEG sources. Network rearrangements of stroke patients were investigated in delta, alpha 2, beta 2 and gamma bands in comparison with healthy subjects. Results: The delta network remodeling was similar in cerebellar and middle cerebral artery strokes, with a reduction of small-worldness. Beta 2 and gamma small-worldness, in the right hemisphere of patients with cerebellar stroke, increase respect to healthy subjects, while alpha 2 small-worldness increases only among patients with a middle cerebral artery stroke. Conclusions: The network remodeling characteristics are independent on the size of the ischemic lesion. In the early post-acute stages cerebellar stroke differs from the middle cerebral artery one because it does not cause alpha 2 network remodeling while it determines a high frequency network reorganization in beta 2 and gamma bands with an increase of small-worldness characteristics. Significance: These findings demonstrate changes in the balance of local segregation and global integration induced by cerebellar acute stroke in high EEG frequency bands. They need to be integrated with appropriate follow-up to explore whether further network changes are attained during post-stroke outcome stabilization.},

The primary objective was to identify the QEEG slowing index and threshold value which can most accurately discriminate between IS patients and controls. Methods: The samples comprised 28 controls (mean age: 70.4; range: 56-84) and 18 patients (mean age: 69.3; range: 51-86). Seven indices were analysed: relative bandpower (delta, theta, alpha, beta), delta/alpha power ratio (DAR), (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (DTABR) and QSLOWING. The accuracies of each index for classifying participants (IS or control) were analysed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) techniques. Results: All indices differed significantly between the samples ({\textless} .001). DAR alone exhibited optimal classifier accuracy, with a threshold of 3.7 demonstrating 100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for discriminating between radiologically-confirmed, acute IS or control. DTABR and relative delta were the next most accurate classifiers. Conclusions: DAR of 3.7 demonstrated maximal accuracy for classifying all 46 participants as acute IS or control.

A variety of ionic mechanisms support resonance and oscillation in neurons.

Theoretical pressure analyses of traditional and spiral cuffs that support this hypothesis are presented. These analyses are designed to predict the minimum CNR (cuff diameter/nerve diameter ratio) at which there is no interference with intraneural blood flow. A safe CNR of 0.997 is predicted for a 1 mm split-cylinder cuff, while a safe CNR of 0.83 is predicted for a 1 mm spiral cuff.

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116124},
	abstract = {Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive method used to modulate activity of superficial brain regions. Deeper and more steerable stimulation could potentially be achieved using transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS): two high-frequency alternating fields interact to produce a wave with an envelope frequency in the range thought to modulate neural activity. Promising initial results have been reported for experiments with mice. In this study we aim to better understand the electric fields produced with tTIS and examine its prospects in humans through simulations with murine and human head models. A murine head finite element model was used to simulate previously published experiments of tTIS in mice. With a total current of 0.776 mA, tTIS electric field strengths up to 383 V/m were reached in the modeled mouse brain, affirming experimental results indicating that suprathreshold stimulation is possible in mice. Using a detailed anisotropic human head model, tTIS was simulated with systematically varied electrode configurations and input currents to investigate how these parameters influence the electric fields. An exhaustive search with 88 electrode locations covering the entire head (146M current patterns) was employed to optimize tTIS for target field strength and focality. In all analyses, we investigated maximal effects and effects along the predominant orientation of local neurons. Our results showed that it was possible to steer the peak tTIS field by manipulating the relative strength of the two input fields. Deep brain areas received field strengths similar to conventional tACS, but with less stimulation in superficial areas. Maximum field strengths in the human model were much lower than in the murine model, too low to expect direct stimulation effects. While field strengths from tACS were slightly higher, our results suggest that tTIS is capable of producing more focal fields and allows for better steerability. Finally, we present optimal four-electrode current patterns to maximize tTIS in regions of the pallidum (0.37 V/m), hippocampus (0.24 V/m) and motor cortex (0.57 V/m).},

	abstract = {Neuroprostheses based on electrical stimulation are becoming a therapeutic reality, dramatically improving the life of disabled people. They are based on neural interfaces that are designed to create an intimate contact with neural cells. These devices speak the language of electron currents, while the human nervous system uses ionic currents to communicate. A deep understanding of the complex interplay between these currents, during the electrical stimulation, is essential for the development of optimized neuroprostheses. Neural electrodes can have different geometries, placement within the nervous system, and the stimulation protocols (paradigms of use). This high-dimensional problem is not tractable by an empiric, brute-force approach and should be tackled by exact computational models, making use of our accumulated knowledge. In pursuit of this goal, a hybrid finite element method-NEURON modeling-is used for a solution of electrical field generated by stimulation, within the different neural structures having anisotropic conductivity, and a corresponding neural response computation. In this work, an important correction of perineurium electrical conductivity is computed. Models of median and sciatic nerves, innervating the hand and foot areas, relevant to the development of bionic hands and legs with sensory feedback, are implemented. The obtained results have the potential to optimize the design of neural interfaces, in terms of shape and number of stimulating contacts. Guidelines for the neurosurgical planning are proposed, by indicating the optimal number of implants for a specific nerve to obtain the best efficacy with the lowest invasiveness. The interpretation is proposed for one of the basic problems of neural interfaces, consisting in the change of the stimulation threshold due to fibrotic reaction of tissue. We show that it is possible to use human microstimulation as an experimental setup for testing of afferent stimulation paradigms, which can be translated to further chronic implants. In the future, models will have a key role in the decision of the most appropriate design of customized neuroprostheses, their optimal modality of use, understanding the effects that occur during their use, and minimizing animal and human experimentation.},

This noninvasive technology is able to perform one-point temporal interference (TI) stimulation and stimulates the hippocampus without affecting the overlying cortex in mice. In this study, we introduce the concept of multi-point temporal interference (MTI) stimulation, which can simultaneously stimulate multiple nodes in the brain network to modulate its function. For the sake of realizing MTI stimulation, we proposed the scheme with each electrode carrying different frequency currents, which has higher usability with respect to the scheme by adding more electrode pairs. Additionally, to optimize the MTI stimulation, we selected the proper current frequencies and amplitudes, which were verified by geometrical model, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) human head model, and tissue phantom. Finally, we tested the independence between the two stimulation points in MTI stimulation. The MTI stimulation can be generated by our method with proper parameters in geometrical model, MRI human head model, and tissue phantom. The stimulation points in MTI stimulation are all steerable, and furthermore can be controlled independently. Our results suggest that MTI stimulation can be used to simultaneously stimulate multiple target nodes of the brain network in deep brain areas noninvasively, which paves the way for the modulation of the brain in research and clinical neurobiology.},

	abstract = {Considerable scientific and technological efforts have been devoted to develop neuroprostheses and hybrid bionic systems that link the human nervous system with electronic or robotic prostheses, with the main aim of restoring motor and sensory functions in disabled patients. Such developments have also the potential to be applied to normal human beings to improve their physical capabilities for bidirectional control and feedback of machines. A number of neuroprostheses use interfaces with peripheral nerves or muscles for neuromuscular stimulation and signal recording. This chapter provides a general overview of the peripheral neural interfaces available and their use from research to clinical application in controlling artificial and robotic prostheses and in developing neuroprostheses. Extraneural electrodes, such as cuff and epineurial electrodes, provide simultaneous interface with many axons in the nerve, whereas intrafascicular, penetrating, and regenerative electrodes may selectively contact small groups of axons within a nerve fascicle. Biological and technical issues are reviewed relative to the problems of electrode design and tissue injury. The last sections review different strategies for the use of peripheral neural interfaces in biomedical applications. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In particular, texture discrimination is an important component for the interaction with the environment, but its restoration in amputees has been so far limited to simplified gratings. Here we show that naturalistic textures can be discriminated by trans-radial amputees using intraneural peripheral stimulation and tactile sensors located close to the outer layer of the artificial skin. These sensors exploit the morphological neural computation (MNC) approach, i.e., the embodiment of neural computational functions into the physical structure of the device, encoding normal and shear stress to guarantee a faithful neural temporal representation of stimulus spatial structure. Two trans-radial amputees successfully discriminated naturalistic textures via the MNC-based tactile feedback. The results also allowed to shed light on the relevance of spike temporal encoding in the mechanisms used to discriminate naturalistic textures.

Biomimetic frequency modulation was perceived as more natural, while amplitude modulation enabled better performance in tasks requiring fine identification of the applied force. Notably, the optimal combination of naturalness and sensitivity of the tactile feedback can be achieved with “hybrid” encoding strategies based on simultaneous biomimetic frequency and amplitude neuromodulation. These strategies improved the gross manual dexterity of the subjects during functional task while maintaining high levels of manual accuracy.

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that direct nerve stimulation can be used to provide sensory feedback to hand amputees. The intensity of the elicited sensations can be modulated using the amplitude or frequency of the injected stimuli. However, a comprehensive comparison of the effects of these two encoding strategies on the amputees’ ability to control a prosthesis has not been performed. In this paper, we assessed the performance of two trans-radial amputees controlling a myoelectric hand prosthesis while receiving grip force sensory feedback encoded using either linear modulation of amplitude (LAM) or linear modulation of frequency (LFM) of direct nerve stimulation (namely, bidirectional prostheses). Both subjects achieved similar and significantly above-chance performance when they were asked to exploit LAM or LFM in different tasks. The feedbacks allowed them to discriminate, during manipulation through the robotic hand, objects of different compliances and shapes or different placements on the prosthesis. Similar high performances were obtained when they were asked to apply different levels of force in a random order on a dynamometer using LAM or LFM. In contrast, only the LAM strategy allowed the subjects to continuously modulate the grip pressure on the dynamometer. Furthermore, when long-lasting trains of stimulation were delivered, LFM strategy generated a very fast adaptation phenomenon in the subjects, which caused them to stop perceiving the restored sensations. Both encoding approaches were perceived as very different from the touch feelings of the healthy limb (natural). These results suggest that the choice of specific sensory feedback encodings can have an effect on user performance while grasping. In addition, our results invite the development of new approaches to provide more natural sensory feelings to the users, which could be addressed by a more biomimetic strategy in the future.},

	abstract = {Hand loss is a highly disabling event thatmarkedly affects the quality of life. To achieve a close to natural replacement for the lost hand, the user should be provided with the rich sensations that we naturally perceive when grasping or manipulating an object. Ideal bidirectional hand prostheses should involve both a reliable decoding of the user's intentions and the delivery of nearly "natural" sensory feedback through remnant afferent pathways, simultaneously and in real time. However, current hand prostheses fail to achieve these requirements, particularly because they lack any sensory feedback. We show that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerve fascicles using transversal multichannel intrafascicular electrodes, according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis, physiologically appropriate (near-natural) sensory information can be provided to an amputee during the real-time decoding of different grasping tasks to control a dexterous hand prosthesis. This feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback. Three different force levels were distinguished and consistently used by the subject. The results also demonstrate that a high complexity of perception can be obtained, allowing the subject to identify the stiffness and shape of three different objects by exploiting different characteristics of the elicited sensations. This approach could improve the efficacy and "life-like" quality of hand prostheses, resulting in a keystone strategy for the near-natural replacement of missing hands.

	abstract = {Objective: Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long-term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated. Methods: To this aim, we performed a 6-month clinical study with 3 transradial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks. Results: All subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation-induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.

Here, learning-related changes in M1 excitability were studied with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while na subjects practiced either a ballistic or a ramp pinch task to the 0.5-Hz beat of a metronome. Subjects rapidly learned to optimize ballistic contractions as indicated by a significant increase in peak pinch acceleration and peak force after the 60-min practice epoch. The increase in force and acceleration was associated with an increase in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in a muscle involved in the training (flexor policis brevis) but not in a muscle unrelated to the task (abductor digiti minimi). MEPs returned to their baseline amplitude after subjects had acquired the new skill, whereas no practice-induced changes in MEP amplitude were observed after subjects had overlearned the task, or after practicing slow ramp pinches.

The goal of the present study was to reinvestigate finger motor somatotopy by means of a thorough investigation of standardized movements of the index and little finger of the right hand. Using high resolution fMRI at 3 Tesla, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in a group of 26 subjects were repeatedly measured to achieve reliable statistical results. The center of mass of all activated voxels within the primary motor cortex was calculated for each finger and each run. Results of all runs were averaged to yield an individual index and little finger representation for each subject. The mean center of mass localizations for all subjects were then submitted to a paired t test. Results show a highly significant though small scale somatotopy of fingerspecific activation patterns in the order indicated by Penfields motor homunculus. In addition, considerable overlap of finger specific BOLD responses was found. Comparing various methods of analysis, the mean center of mass distance for the two fingers was 2-3 mm with overlapping voxels included and 4-5 mm with overlapping voxels excluded.

Objective/hypothesis: Different phases of the endogenous sensorimotor μ-rhythm represent different states of corticospinal excitability, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of always the same high- vs. low-excitability state results in long-term plasticity of different direction. Methods: State-dependent electroencephalography-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) was applied to target the EEG negative vs. positive peak of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm in healthy subjects using a millisecond resolution real-time digital signal processing system. Corticospinal excitability was indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude in a hand muscle. Results: EEG negative vs. positive peak of the endogenous sensorimotor μ-rhythm represent high- vs. low-excitability states of corticospinal neurons. More importantly, otherwise identical rTMS (200 triple-pulses at 100 Hz burst frequency and ∼1 Hz repetition rate), triggered consistently at this high-excitability vs. low-excitability state, leads to long-term potentiation (LTP)-like vs. no change in corticospinal excitability. Conclusions: Findings raise the intriguing possibility that real-time information of instantaneous brain state can be utilized to control efficacy of plasticity induction in humans.},

	volume = {3},
	doi = {10.1016/j.brs.2009.10.003},
	abstract = {Background: One major attribute of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is the variability of motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, to which variations of coil positioning may contribute. Navigated TMS allows the investigator to retrieve a stimulation site with an accuracy of 2.5 mm and to retain coil position with low spatial divergence during stimulation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether increased spatial constancy of the coil using a navigational system decreases the variability of MEP amplitudes and increases their reproducibility between different points in time of investigation. Methods: We investigated eight healthy subjects (mean age 23.8 ± 1.2 years, range 22-25, four women, four men) at three different points in time with and without an optically tracked frameless navigational device, respectively. Input-output curves, motor threshold, and MEP amplitudes were recorded. We calculated the coefficient of variation as statistical parameter of variability. Reproducibility between different sessions was assessed via the MEP amplitude. Results: The coefficient of variance of MEP amplitudes did not show a distinct difference between navigated and non-navigated TMS in input-output curves. MEP amplitudes, indicating reproducibility, did not significantly differ between sessions with and without navigated TMS, either. Conclusions: Our results do not support the hypothesis that increased spatial constancy using a navigational system improves variability and reproducibility of MEP amplitudes. Variability of MEPs might mainly be due to not influenceable neurophysiologic factors such as undulant cortical excitability and spinal desynchronization. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a unique method for non-invasive brain imaging. The fundamental difference between TMS and other available non-invasive brain imaging techniques is that when a physiological response is evoked by stimulation of a cortical area, that specific cortical area is causally related to the response. With other imaging methods, it is only possible to detect and map a brain area that participates in a given task or reaction. TMS has been shown to be clinically accurate and effective in mapping cortical motor areas and applicable to the functional assessment of motor tracts following stroke, for example. Many hundreds of studies have been published indicating that repetitive TMS (rTMS) may also have multiple therapeutic applications. Techniques and protocols for individually targeting and dosing rTMS urgently need to be developed in order to ascertain the accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility required of TMS in clinical applications. We review the basic concepts behind navigated TMS and evaluate the currently accepted physical and physiological factors contributing to the accuracy and reproducibility of navigated TMS. The advantages of navigated TMS over functional MRI in motor cortex mapping are briefly discussed. Illustrative cases utilizing navigated TMS are shown in presurgical mapping of the motor cortex, in therapy for depression, and in the follow-up of recovery from stroke.},

We develop a model of human locomotion that is controlled by muscle reflexes which encode principles of legged mechanics. Equipped with this reflex control, we find this model to stabilize into a walking gait from its dynamic interplay with the ground, reproduce human walking dynamics and leg kinematics, tolerate ground disturbances, and adapt to slopes without parameter interventions. In addition, we find this model to predict some individual muscle activation patterns known from walking experiments. The results suggest not only that the interplay between mechanics and motor control is essential to human locomotion, but also that human motor output could for some muscles be dominated by neural circuits that encode principles of legged mechanics. © 2006 IEEE.},

This comprises (i) identifying and dealing with the model uncertainties, (ii) establishing a clear link between the induced fields and the physiological stimulation effects, and (iii) improving the usability of the tools for field calculation to the level that they can be easily used by non-experts. We then introduce a new version of our pipeline for field calculations (www.simnibs.org) that substantially simplifies setting up and running TMS and tDCS simulations based on Finite-Element Methods (FEM).

	abstract = {Subjects were asked to shape the right hand as if to grasp and use a large number of familiar objects. The chosen objects typically are held with a variety of grips, including "precision" and "power" grips. Static hand posture was measured by recording the angular position of 15 joint angles of the fingers and of the thumb. Although subjects adopted distinct hand shapes for the various objects, the joint angles of the digits did not vary independently. Principal components analysis showed that the first two components could account for {\textgreater}80\% of the variance, implying a substantial reduction from the 15 degrees of freedom that were recorded. However, even though they were small, higher-order (more than three) principal components did not represent random variability but instead provided additional information about the object. These results suggest that the control of hand posture involves a few postural synergies, regulating the general shape of the hand, coupled with a finer control mechanism providing for small, subtle adjustments. Because the postural synergies did not coincide with grip taxonomies, the results suggest that hand posture may be regulated independently from the control of the contact forces that are used to grasp an object.},

	doi = {10.1007/s004220050362},
	abstract = {Tongue movements during speech production have been investigated by means of a simple yet realistic biomechanical model, based on a finite elements modeling of soft tissues, in the framework of the equilibrium point hypothesis (λ-model) of motor control. In particular, the model has been applied to the estimation of the "central" control commands issued to the muscles, for a data set of mid-sagittal digitized tracings of vocal tract shape, recorded by means of low-intensity X-ray cineradiographies during speech. In spite of the highly non-linear mapping between the shape of the oral cavity and its acoustic consequences, the organization of control commands preserves the peculiar spatial organization of vowel phonemes in acoustic space. A factor analysis of control commands, which have been decomposed into independent or "orthogonal" muscle groups, has shown that, in spite of the great mobility of the tongue and the highly complex arrangement of tongue muscles, its movements can be explained in terms of the activation of a small number of independent muscle groups, each corresponding to an elementary or "primitive" movement. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the tongue is controlled by a small number of independent "articulators", for which a precise biomechanical substrate is provided. The influence of the effect of jaw and hyoid movements on tongue equilibrium has also been evaluated, suggesting that the bony structures cannot be considered as a moving frame of reference, but, indeed, there may be a substantial interaction between them and the tongue, that may only be accounted for by a "global" model. The reported results also define a simple control model for the tongue and, in analogy with similar modelling studies, they suggest that, because of the peculiar geometrical arrangement of tongue muscles, the central nervous system (CNS) may not need a detailed representation of tongue mechanics but rather may make use of a relatively small number of muscle synergies, that are invariant over the whole space of tongue configurations.},

Merging these concepts into a single coherent scheme requires focusing on control variables rather than performance variables. The principle of minimal final action is formulated as the guiding principle within the referent configuration hypothesis. Motor actions are associated with setting two types of variables by a controller, those that ultimately define average performance patterns and those that define associated synergies. Predictions of the suggested scheme are reviewed, such as the phenomenon of anticipatory synergy adjustments, quick actions without changes in synergies, atypical synergies, and changes in synergies with practice.

	abstract = {1. Non-invasive mapping by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is frequently used to investigate cortical motor function in the intact and injured human brain. We examined how TMS-derived maps relate to the underlying cortical anatomy and to cortical maps generated by functional imaging studies. 2. The centres of gravity (COGs) of TMS maps of the first dorsal intersosseus muscle (FDI) were integrated into 3-D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets in eleven subjects. In seven of these subjects the TMS-derived COGs were compared with the COG of regional cerebral blood flow increases using positron emission tomography (PET) in an index finger flexion protocol. 3. Mean TMS-derived COG projections were located on the posterior lip of the precentral gyrus and TMS-derived COG projections were in close proximity to the mean PET-derived COG, suggesting that the two methods reflect activity of similar cortical elements. 4. Criteria for a reliable assessment of the COG and the number of positions with a minimum amplitude of two-thirds of the maximum motor-evoked potential (T3Ps) were determined as a function of the number of stimuli and extension of the stimulation field. COGs and T3Ps were compared with an estimate of the size of the human motor cortex targeting α-motoneurons of forearm muscles. This comparison suggests that TMX can retrieve spatial information on cortical organization below the macroanatomic scale of cortical regions. 5. Finally, we studied the cortical representation of hand muscles in relation to facial and foot muscle representations and investigated hemispherical asymmetries. We did not find any evidence for a different ipsi- or contralateral representation of the mentalis muscle. Also, no difference was found between FDI representations on the dominant versus the non-dominant hemisphere.},

The effect is enhanced in patients with Parkinson's disease. Although previous studies have agreed that the effect is cortical, there is disagreement over exactly which cortical mechanisms are involved. The aim of this study was to provide further evidence for cortical involvement in LICI. Methods: Recordings of corticospinal volleys evoked by the TMS stimulation were made from electrodes inserted into the cervical epidural space of 4 conscious subjects. Three of the patients had received the electrodes for treatment of lumbo-sacral pain; the other patient had vascular parkinsonism, and had the electrode implanted to evaluate its effect on cerebral blood flow. The number and amplitude of the volleys were compared with and without a conditioning stimulus. Results: In 3 pain patients, a conditioning stimulus suppressed the later components of the corticospinal volley (I2 and later waves) when the interval between stimuli was 100-150 ms; at 50 ms the responses were enhanced. Early components of the volley were not affected. Inhibition was much more pronounced and involved all descending volleys except the D wave in the patient with vascular parkinsonism. Conclusions: LICI, which is conventionally described in EMG recordings, is also evident in recordings of descending corticospinal volleys and appears enhanced in a patient with vascular parkinsonism. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCPs) from the cervical epidural space and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the hand muscles were recorded simultaneously in 6 subjects following transcranial magnetic stimulation in two different coil orientations on motor cortex. The onset latency of the MEPs was approximately 1 ms shorter when the induced current flowed in a latero-medial direction (L-M stimulation) on the motor cortex as compared to a postero-anterior direction (P-A stimulation). Hence, L-M stimulation elicited an earlier component of the ESCPs than that induced by P-A stimulation. During general anesthesia with Sevoflurane, only the first component of the ESCPs could be elicited routinely following L-M stimulation. In contrast, all components of the ESCPs were dramatically attenuated following P-A stimulation. Moreover, first component latency of the ESCPs induced by L-M stimulation was almost the same as that induced by transcranial anodal electrical stimulation. These results suggest that if the induced current following transcranial magnetic stimulation flows in a latero-medial direction on motor cortex, it preferentially stimulates the corticospinal tract non-synaptically (producing a D-wave). However, if the induced current flows in a postero-anterior direction, it preferentially stimulates the corticospinal tract trans-synaptically (producing I-waves). Therefore, the direction of magnetically induced current is crucial in determining corticospinal excitability in the human brain.},

	abstract = {Transcranial stimulation of the human motor cortex can evoke several different kinds of descending activity depending on the type of stimulation, the intensity of stimulation and the area of the cortex being stimulated. Thus, transcranial magnetic stimulation preferentially activates different structures than transcranial electrical stimulation. In addition, the response to magnetic stimulation depends on the direction of the induced current in the brain, the waveform of the stimulating current, and the shape of the coil. Stimulation of the lower limb area of motor cortex recruits different elements than stimulation of the upper limb area. These differences occur because different structures in the motor cortex have a differential threshold to the different techniques of stimulation. We have had the opportunity to perform a series of direct recordings of the corticospinal volley evoked by the different techniques of transcranial stimulation from the epidural space of conscious patients with chronically implanted spinal electrodes.

In both cases the equations are similar and can be treated in parallel. The activity of the axon depends on the second space derivative of the extracellular medium.

	abstract = {1. In ten normal volunteers, a transcranial magnetic or electric stimulus that was subthreshold for evoking an EMG response in relaxed muscles was used to condition responses evoked by a later, suprathreshold magnetic or electric test shock. In most experiments the test stimulus was given to the lateral part of the motor strip in order to evoke EMG responses in the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). 2. A magnetic conditioning stimulus over the hand area of cortex could suppress responses produced in the relaxed FDI by a suprathreshold magnetic test stimulus at interstimulus intervals of 1‐6 ms. At interstimulus intervals of 10 and 15 ms, the test response was facilitated. 3. Using a focal magnetic stimulus we explored the effects of moving the conditioning stimulus to different scalp locations while maintaining the magnetic test coil at one site. If the conditioning coil was moved anterior or posterior to the motor strip there was less suppression of test responses in the FDI. In contrast, stimulation at the vertex could suppress FDI responses by an amount comparable to that seen with stimulation over the hand area. With the positions of the two coils reversed, conditioning stimuli over the hand area suppressed responses evoked in leg muscles by vertex test shocks. 4. The intensity of both conditioning and test shocks influenced the amount of suppression. Small test responses were more readily suppressed than large responses. The best suppression was seen with small conditioning stimuli (0.7‐0.9 times motor threshold in relaxed muscle); increasing the intensity to motor threshold or above resulted in less suppression or even facilitation. 5. Two experiments suggested that the suppression was produced by an action on cortical, rather than spinal excitability. First, a magnetic conditioning stimulus over the hand area failed to produce any suppression of responses evoked in active hand muscles by a small (approximately 200 V, 50 microsecond time constant) anodal electric test shock. Second, a vertex conditioning shock had no effect on forearm flexor H reflexes even though responses in the same muscles produced by magnetic cortical test shocks were readily suppressed at appropriate interstimulus intervals. 6. Small anodal electric conditioning stimuli were much less effective in suppressing magnetic test responses than either magnetic or cathodal electric conditioning shocks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1993 The Physiological Society},

	abstract = {We studied the changes in motor pathway excitability induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, using paired stimuli (conditioning and test stimulus) and varying interstimulus interval (ISI). The effects induced depended on the stimulus intensity. At a low intensity, there was inhibition of the response to the test stimulus at ISIs of 5-40 msec, followed by facilitation at ISIs of 50-90 msec. At a high intensity, there was facilitation at ISIs of 25-50 msec, followed by inhibition at ISIs of 60-150 msec and, occassionally, by another phase of facilitation at ISIs of more than 200 msec. Only tentative explanations are currently possible for these effects: the inhibition observed at low intensities and short ISIs may be due to activation of cortical inhibitory mechanisms. The facilitation that follows may arise from the coincidence of various factors that transiently increase the excitability in alpha motoneurons. The early facilitation observed at high intensities seems to be a consequence of a rise in cortical excitability induced by the conditioning stimulus, causing an increase in the number or size, or both, of descending volleys from the test stimulus. The profound inhibition that follows probably results from a combination of both segmental and suprasegmental inhibitory mechanisms. © 1992.},

During contraction, fewer peaks of facilitation were observed. Facilitation was evident if the stimuli were 0.9-1.1 times threshold in the relaxed state, and 1.0-1.1 times threshold during voluntary contraction. Experiments using either magnetic followed by anodal electric stimulation, or pairs of anodal electric stimuli, suggested that the facilitation most likely occurred within the cerebral motor cortex.

In 5 healthy subjects we delivered MCS either with a circular coil centered at the vertex or a figure-8 coil centered over the motor cortex hand area, recording from first dorsal interosseous. With the subject at rest or exerting 5\% maximum voluntary contraction, 30 consecutive stimuli were given at 4 stimulus intensities (SIs) in 10\% increments above resting motor threshold. Concurrent mental arithmetic constituted mental alertness. Spectral analysis was performed on data from 300 consecutive stimuli. The variability of MEP response size was inversely related to stimulus intensity, prestimulus voluntary muscle contraction, the recruitment of motoneurons and the size of the field generated by the magnetic coil. The MEP variability was larger than and not correlated with the variability of the H-reflex. Fast Fourier transformation and cross-correlation analysis did not identify a consistent dominant frequency, suggesting that the variability in MEP size is essentially random. We suggest that the variability in MEP response is caused by constant, rapid, spontaneous fluctuations in corticospinal and segmental motoneuron excitability levels. Any maneuver that raises this level or increases the probability of motoneuron firing will decrease MEP variability. © 1993.},

	abstract = {1. The magnetic field generated by a brief current in a 9 cm diameter flat circular coil varies rapidly with time and when applied over the human scalp it is capable of exciting motor structures subserving the small hand muscles. With a peak magnetic field at the centre of the coil of 0.9‐1.6 Tesla, single scalp stimuli produced twitches in the right abductor digiti minimi (a.d.m.), first dorsal interosseous (f.d.i.) and adductor pollicis muscles. Compound muscle action potentials (c.m.a.p.s) and single motor units from these muscles were recorded. 2. The twitch force and corresponding c.m.a.p. were greatly enhanced by voluntary background contraction of the muscle and depended on the direction and intensity of the magnetic field. Response amplitude was maximal with the stimulating coil centred near the vertex but precise coil position was not critical. 3. When the orthodromic volley set up in the peripheral nerve by magnetic stimulation of the brain collided with a maximal antidromic volley set up by stimulation at the wrist, remaining electromyographic (e.m.g.) activity gave evidence of multiple firing of some spinal motoneurones, provided that the muscle exerted a slight voluntary background contraction and the stimulus intensity was above threshold for relaxed muscle. 4. When the muscle changed from total relaxation to a slightly contracted state the onset latency of the c.m.a.p. was shortened by about 3 ms without further change when the background contraction increased. In slightly contracted muscle, c.m.a.p. onset latency was little affected over a wide range of stimulus intensities and was unaffected by the position of the stimulating coil within an area of 6 X 6 cm over the vertex. 5. Single motor units, recorded with needle electrodes in the a.d.m. or f.d.i. muscle, could be caused to discharge at a constant latency by threshold brain stimuli. Different single motor units had latencies varying from 22.4 to 32.1 ms. The same motor unit was activated from different coil positions up to 7 cm apart. These motor units had the lowest thresholds for voluntary activation. Stronger stimuli caused the same motor unit to discharge 1.5 ms earlier. 6. The threshold for excitation of pathways to the a.d.m. muscle was reduced by voluntary contraction of the contralateral a.d.m. and by contraction of the ipsilateral f.d.i. muscles. Using these procedures, the c.m.a.p. of totally relaxed a.d.m. muscle showed a more than 2‐fold amplitude increase, a shortening of onset latency to a similar degree as with contraction of the muscle itself, and single motor units in the a.d.m. muscle discharged 1.5 ms earlier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1987 The Physiological Society},

	abstract = {The ventral premotor area (F5) is part of the cortical circuit controlling visuomotor grasp. F5 could influence hand motor function through at least two pathways: corticospinal projections and corticocortical projections to primary motor cortex (MI). We found that stimulation of macaque F5, which by itself evoked little or no detectable corticospinal output, could produce a robust modulation of motor outputs from M1. Arrays of fine microwires were implanted in F5 and M1. During terminal experiments under chloralose anesthesia, single stimuli delivered to M1 electrodes evoked direct (D) and indirect (I 1, I2, and I3) corticospinal volleys. In contrast, single F5 shocks were ineffective; double shocks (3 msec separation) evoked small I waves but no D wave. However, when the test (T) M1 shock was conditioned (C) by single or double F5 shocks, there was strong facilitation of I2 and I3 waves from M1, with C-T intervals of {\textgreater}1 msec. Intracellular recordings from 79 arm and hand motoneurons (MNs) revealed no postsynaptic effects from single F5 shocks. In contrast, these stimuli produced a robust facilitation of I2 and I3 EPSPs evoked from M1 (60\% of MNs); this was particularly marked in hand muscle MNs (92\%). Muscimol injection in M1 reduced I waves from F5 and abolished the F5-induced facilitation of late I waves from M1, and of EPSPs associated with them. Thus, some motor effects evoked from F5 may be mediated by corticocortical inputs to M1 impinging on interneurons generating late corticospinal I waves. Similar mechanisms may allow F5 to modulate grasp-related outputs from M1.},

	abstract = {Magnetic stimulators consist of a high-voltage (400 V to more than 3 kV), high-current (4 kA to more than 20 kA) discharge system producing a brief pulse of magnetic field (1-10 T lasting up to a few milliseconds). In order to ensure safety and reliability, care has to be taken in the construction of magnetic stimulators and especially their stimulating coils, which may come into contact with the patient, by the use of adequate mechanical and electrical insulation and the incorporation of sensors to monitor temperature, voltage, etc. Where possible, equipment should be manufactured to comply with safety standards such as UL504 and IEC601. The effectiveness of a magnetic stimulator depends on many parameters such as the maximization of the peak coil energy, fast magnetic field rise times, and good coil design. It is also important to choose a coil based on its intended clinical application and not simply on account of its high magnetic field strength. A small coil, producing a high surface magnetic field, is suitable in the stimulation of superficial nerves, whereas a larger coil, with a low magnetic field intensity, may well be more suitable for the stimulation of deep nerves. Double, figure-eight, or butterfly coils produce more localised induced currents allowing for more selective stimulation. The exposure of the brain to high magnetic field strengths can also be reduced by using larger coils.},

	abstract = {Background Prefrontal Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy repeated daily over 4-6 weeks (20-30 sessions) is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treating Major Depressive Disorder in adults who have not responded to prior antidepressant medications. In 2011, leading TMS clinical providers and researchers created the Clinical TMS Society (cTMSs) (www.clinicaltmssociety.org, Greenwich, CT, USA), incorporated in 2013. Methods This consensus review was written by cTMSs leaders, informed by membership polls, and approved by the governing board. It summarizes current evidence for the safety and efficacy of the use of TMS therapy for treating depression in routine clinical practice. Authors systematically reviewed the published TMS antidepressant therapy clinical trials. Studies were then assessed and graded on their strength of evidence using the Levels of Evidence framework published by the University of Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. The authors then summarize essentials for using TMS therapy in routine clinical practice settings derived from discussions and polls of cTMSs members. Finally, each summary clinical recommendation is presented with the substantiating peer-reviewed, published evidence supporting that recommendation. When the current published clinical trial evidence was insufficient or incomplete, expert opinion was included when sufficient consensus was available from experienced clinician users among the membership of the cTMSs, who were polled at the Annual Meetings in 2014 and 2015. Conclusions Daily left prefrontal TMS has substantial evidence of efficacy and safety for treating the acute phase of depression in patients who are treatment resistant or intolerant. Following the clinical recommendations in this document should result in continued safe and effective use of this exciting new treatment modality.},

	abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a 20-year-old technique originally introduced to noninvasively investigate nervous propagation along the corticospinal tract, spinal roots, and peripheral nerves in humans. TMS is extensively used in clinical neurophysiology, including rehabilitation and intraoperative monitoring. Single-pulse TMS and other more recent versions (paired-pulse TMS, repetitive TMS, integration with structural and functional MRI, and neuronavigation) allow motor output to be mapped precisely to a given body district. Moreover, TMS can be used to evaluate excitatory/inhibitory intracortical circuits and to provide information on brain physiology and pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric diseases as well as on the mechanisms of brain plasticity and of neuroactive drugs. TMS applied over nonmotor areas made it possible to extend research applications (often complementary with other functional neuroimaging techniques) in several fields of psychophysiology, causally testing brain-behavior relationships. Being able to induce relatively long-lasting excitability changes, repetitive TMS has made the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases linked with brain excitability dysfunctions possible. These uses, however, warrant further large-scale studies. In emerging fields of research, TMS-EEG co-registration is considered a promising approach to evaluate corticocortical connectivity and brain reactivity with high temporal resolution. However, safety and ethical limitations of TMS technique need a high level of vigilance. ©2007AAN Enterprises, Inc..},

	abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive means of electrically stimulating neurons in the human cerebral cortex, is able to modify neuronal activity locally and at distant sites when delivered in series or trains of pulses. Data from stimulation of the motor cortex suggest that the type of effect on the excitability of the cortical network depends on the frequency of stimulation. These data, as well as results from studies in rodents, have been generalized across brain areas and species to provide rationales for using repetitive TMS (rTMS) to treat various brain disorders, most notably depression. Research into clinical applications for TMS remains active and has the potential to provide useful data, but, to date, the results of blinded, sham-controlled trials do not provide clear evidence of beneficial effects that replace or even match the effectiveness of conventional treatments in any disorder.

Single letters, subtending a visual angle of 0.35 degrees, were foveally presented for 10 ms and were immediately followed by a mask. We investigated 30 different delays (d), defined as the time between the onset of the visual stimulus and the onset of the magnetic stimulus, from d = -100 ms to d = +190 ms, and 4 different midsagittal coil positions (x), defined as the distance between the lower edge of the coil and the upper edge of the inion, from x = 1 cm to x = 7 cm. Three out of four subjects showed three distinct delay intervals (dips) at which application of TMS resulted in an impairment of the task. The first dip was centred around d = -50 ms and occurred independently of the coil position; the second dip was centred around d = 0 ms and was elicitable only with the two lowest coil positions; the third dip was centred around d = 100 ms and was also elicitable only with the lower coil positions. In the fourth subject, only the first and the third dip were found. We conclude that there are two distinct periods when the activity in the (circum)striate visual cortex is necessary for the identification of visually presented letters.},

	abstract = {Background: Diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with substantial diagnostic delays. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of a threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique, which might allow early detection of upper motor neuron dysfunction, for the diagnosis of the disorder. Methods: We did a prospective study of patients referred to three neuromuscular centres in Sydney, Australia, in accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy. Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months. All patients underwent threshold tracking TMS at recruitment (index test), with application of the reference standard, the Awaji criteria, to differentiate patients with ALS from those with non-ALS disorders. The investigators who did the index test were masked to the results of the reference test and all other investigations. The primary outcome measures were the sensitivity and specificity of TMS in differentiating ALS from non-ALS disorders; these measures were derived from receiver operator curve analysis. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2010, and March 1, 2014, we screened 333 patients; 281 met our inclusion criteria. We eventually diagnosed 209 patients with ALS and 68 with non-ALS disorders; the diagnosis of four patients was inconclusive. The threshold tracking TMS technique differentiated ALS from non-ALS disorders with a sensitivity of 73·21\% (95\% CI 66·66-79·08) and specificity of 80·88\% (69·53-89·40) at an early stage in the disease. All patients tolerated the study well, and we did not record any adverse events from performance of the index test. Interpretation: The threshold tracking TMS technique reliably distinguishes ALS from non-ALS disorders and, if these findings are replicated in larger studies, could represent a useful diagnostic investigation when combined with the Awaji criteria to prove upper motor neuron dysfunction at early stages of ALS.

	abstract = {Objective: To study the short-term effects of slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex on cortical excitability and handwriting in patients with writer's cramp. Background: Cortical excitability of the primary motor cortex is abnormally enhanced in patients with writer's cramp. Therefore, reducing cortical excitability by low-frequency rTMS of the motor cortex might result in beneficial effects on handwriting in writer's cramp. Design/Methods: We studied the effects of subthreshold 1-Hz rTMS on motor threshold and cortico-cortical excitability using the paired-pulse technique in seven patients and seven controls. In another 16 patients and 11 age-matched controls we evaluated changes in cortical excitability by measuring the stimulus-response curve and the postexcitatory silent period before and after subthreshold 1-Hz rTMS. In addition, we analyzed the handwriting before and 20 minutes after 1-Hz rTMS. Results: In the first experiment, low-frequency rTMS resulted in a normalization of the deficient cortico-cortical inhibition in the patients without affecting motor threshold. In the second experiment, 1-Hz rTMS resulted in a significant prolongation of the postexcitatory silent period without affecting the stimulus-response curve in the patient group. Moreover, the dystonic patients showed a significant reduction of mean writing pressure after subthreshold 1-Hz rTMS that was associated with clear but transient improvement in six patients. Conclusions: In some patients 1-Hz rTMS can reinforce deficient intracortical inhibition and may improve handwriting temporarily. Our data support the notion that reduced intracortical inhibition plays a part in the pathophysiology of focal dystonia.},

In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effects of 25 Hz rTMS in 18 PD patients. Eight rTMS sessions were performed over a 4-week period. Four cortical targets (left and right motor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were stimulated in each session, with 300 pulses each, 100\% of motor threshold intensity. Left motor cortex (MC) excitability was assessed using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the abductor pollicis brevis. During the 4 weeks, times for executing walking and complex hand movements tests gradually decreased. The therapeutic rTMS effect lasted for at least 1 month after treatment ended. Right-hand bradykinesia improvement correlated with increased MEP amplitude evoked by left MC rTMS after individual sessions, but improvement overall did not correlate with MC excitability. rTMS sessions appear to have a cumulative benefit for improving gait, as well as reducing upper limb bradykinesia in PD patients.

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the descending motor activity evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a chronic alcoholic patient with a slight atrophy of the peri-central cortex and compare with that observed in neurologically intact subjects. Methods: EMGs from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, and descending activity from an electrode implanted in the high cervical epidural space for relief of pain were recorded after TMS of the hand area of motor cortex. A figure-of-8 coil was used to induce either a posterior-anterior (PA) or a latero-medial (LM) flow across the central sulcus. Results: In intact subjects, LM stimulation evoked the earliest volley, which we termed a D wave. This was followed by later, presumed I waves at intervals of about 1.5 ms. At a stimulus intensity of 120\% resting threshold (RMT), up to 5 I waves were seen. PA stimulation rarely evoked D waves at intensities up to 120\% RMT, but 3 or 4 I waves were visible in all subjects. The patient had an increased resting threshold, and the descending volleys were dominated by a D wave. I waves were unclear, with two possible small peaks at 5.5 and 7.2 ms. Conclusions: The lack of I waves in the patient was probably due to an impairment of interneuronal circuitry in the context of the brain damage related to chronic alcohol abuse, and is consistent with a trans-synaptic origin of the I waves in humans. The intact D wave is consistent with the assumption that the D wave represents direct stimulation of the axons of intact corticospinal neurones in the subcortical white matter. The patient's increased RMT reflects the fact that usually multiple descending volleys are needed to discharge resting spinal motoneurones. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Yet questions persist about how the CNS combines these primitives in different ways to suit the task conditions. The MS hypothesis has been a subject of debate as to whether they originate from neural origins or nonneural constraints. In this review article, we present three aspects related to the MS hypothesis: (1) the experimental and computational evidence in support of the existence of MS, (2) algorithmic approaches for extracting them from surface electromyography (EMG) signals, and (3) the possible role of MS as a neurorehabilitation tool. We note that recent advances in computational neuroscience have utilized the MS hypothesis in motor control and learning. Prospective advances in clinical, medical, and engineering sciences and in fields such as robotics and rehabilitation stand to benefit from a more thorough understanding of MS.},

	abstract = {Motor system uses muscle synergies as a modular organization to simplify the control of movements. Motor cortical impairments, such as stroke and spinal cord injuries, disrupt the orchestration of the muscle synergies and result in abnormal movements. In this paper, the alterations of muscle synergies in subacute stroke survivors were examined during the voluntary reaching movement. We collected electromyographic (EMG) data from 35 stroke survivors, ranging from Brunnstrom Stage III to VI, and 25 age-matched control subjects. Muscle synergies were extracted from the activity of 7 upper-limb muscles via nonnegative matrix factorization under the criterion of 95\% variance accounted for. By comparing the structure of muscle synergies and the similarity of activation coefficients across groups, we can validate the increasing activation of pectoralis major muscle and the decreasing activation of elbow extensor of triceps in stroke groups. Furthermore, the similarity of muscle synergies was significantly correlated with the Brunnstrom Stage (R = 0.52, p {\textless} 0.01). The synergies of stroke survivors at Brunnstrom Stage IV–III gradually diverged from those of control group, but the activation coefficients remained the same after stroke, irrespective of the recovery level.},

	abstract = {The linear two block predictive PLS model (PPLS2) is often used to model the relation between two data matrices, X and Y. Applications include multivariate calibration, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), and process optimization. In each PPLS2 model dimension the matrices X and Y are decomposed as bilinear products plus residual matrices: X = tp′ + E Y = uq′ + F. In addition, a linear model is assumed to relate the score vectors t and u (h denotes residuals): u = bt + h. This allows Y to be modeled by t and q as: Y = tq′b + f\{hook\}*. In the present work the linear PPLS2 model is extended to the case when the inner model relating the block scores u and t is nonlinear (h is a vector of residuals): u = f\{hook\}(t) + h. An algorithm is outlined for the model where the inner relation is a quadratic polynomial: u = c0 + c1t + c2t2 + h. This will be referred to as the QPLS2 model (standing for quadratic PLS with two blocks).

Here we investigate whether prolonged peripheral nerve stimulation can induce reorganization within the human motor cortex. METHODS Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we mapped the scalp representation of the corticospinal projection to hand muscles in 8 normal subjects before and after 2h of simultaneous repetitive electrical stimulation of the ulnar and radial nerves at the wrist. Control mapping experiments were conducted in 6 subjects. RESULTS Following nerve stimulation, larger motor-evoked potentials were evoked from more scalp sites. The induced changes were most apparent in first dorsal interosseous, but were also seen in other hand muscles. The increases in area of the representational maps were accompanied by changes in the location of the optimal site for evoking responses in first dorsal interosseous, and changes in the centres of gravity of the maps. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged afferent stimulation induces an increase in excitability of the corticospinal projection. This is accompanied by a significant shift in the centre of gravity of the stimulated muscles which we propose is evidence of a non-uniform expansion in their cortical representation.},

	abstract = {The detailed biophysical mechanisms through which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) activates cortical circuits are still not fully understood. Here we present a multi-scale computational model to describe and explain the activation of different pyramidal cell types in motor cortex due to TMS. Our model determines precise electric fields based on an individual head model derived from magnetic resonance imaging and calculates how these electric fields activate morphologically detailed models of different neuron types. We predict neural activation patterns for different coil orientations consistent with experimental findings. Beyond this, our model allows us to calculate activation thresholds for individual neurons and precise initiation sites of individual action potentials on the neurons' complex morphologies. Specifically, our model predicts that cortical layer 3 pyramidal neurons are generally easier to stimulate than layer 5 pyramidal neurons, thereby explaining the lower stimulation thresholds observed for I-waves compared to D-waves. It also shows differences in the regions of activated cortical layer 5 and layer 3 pyramidal cells depending on coil orientation. Finally, it predicts that under standard stimulation conditions, action potentials are mostly generated at the axon initial segment of cortical pyramidal cells, with a much less important activation site being the part of a layer 5 pyramidal cell axon where it crosses the boundary between grey matter and white matter. In conclusion, our computational model offers a detailed account of the mechanisms through which TMS activates different cortical pyramidal cell types, paving the way for more targeted application of TMS based on individual brain morphology in clinical and basic research settings.},

We recently identified synergies in electromyography (EMG) recordings associated with both voluntary movement and movement evoked by high-frequency long-duration intracortical microstimulation applied to the forelimb representation of the primary motor cortex (M1). The goal of this study was to use stimulus-triggered averaging (StTA) of EMG activity to investigate the synergy profiles and weighting coefficients associated with poststimulus facilitation, as synergies may be hard-wired into elemental cortical output modules and revealed by StTA. We applied StTA at low (LOW, {\textasciitilde}15 μA) and high intensities (HIGH, {\textasciitilde}110 μA) to 247 cortical locations of the M1 forelimb region in two male rhesus macaques while recording the EMG of 24 forelimb muscles. Our results show that 10 –11 synergies accounted for 90\% of the variation in poststimulus EMG facilitation peaks from the LOW-intensity StTA dataset while only 4 –5 synergies were needed for the HIGH-intensity dataset. Synergies were similar across monkeys and current intensities. Most synergy profiles strongly activated only one or two muscles; all joints were represented and most, but not all, joint directions of motion were represented. Cortical maps of the synergy weighting coefficients suggest only a weak organization. StTA of M1 resulted in highly diverse muscle activations, suggestive of the limiting condition of requiring a synergy for each muscle to account for the patterns observed.},

	doi = {10.3389/fnhum.2015.00165},
	abstract = {The large number of mechanical degrees of freedom of the hand is not fully exploited during actual movements such as grasping. Usually, angular movements in various joints tend to be coupled, and EMG activities in different hand muscles tend to be correlated. The occurrence of covariation in the former was termed kinematic synergies, in the latter muscle synergies. This study addresses two questions: (i) Whether kinematic and muscle synergies can simultaneously accommodate for kinematic and kinetic constraints. (ii) If so, whether there is an interrelation between kinematic and muscle synergies. We used a reach-grasp-and-pull paradigm and recorded the hand kinematics as well as eight surface EMGs. Subjects had to either perform a precision grip or side grip and had to modify their grip force in order to displace an object against a low or high load. The analysis was subdivided into three epochs: reach, grasp-and-pull, and static hold. Principal component analysis (PCA, temporal or static) was performed separately for all three epochs, in the kinematic and in the EMG domain. PCA revealed that (i) Kinematic- and muscle-synergies can simultaneously accommodate kinematic (grip type) and kinetic task constraints (load condition). (ii) Upcoming grip and load conditions of the grasp are represented in kinematic- and muscle-synergies already during reach. Phase plane plots of the principal muscle-synergy against the principal kinematic synergy revealed (iii) that the muscle-synergy is linked (correlated, and in phase advance) to the kinematic synergy during reach and during grasp-and-pull. Furthermore (iv), pair-wise correlations of EMGs during hold suggest that muscle-synergies are (in part) implemented by coactivation of muscles through common input. Together, these results suggest that kinematic synergies have (at least in part) their origin not just in muscular activation, but in synergistic muscle activation. In short: kinematic synergies may result from muscle synergies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We used a particular computational approach, the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, to investigate joint angle covariation patterns during whole-body actions performed by standing persons. We hypothesized that two kinematic synergies accounted for the leg/trunk joint covariation across cycles during a rhythmic whole-body motion to stabilize two performance variables, the trunk orientation in the external space and the horizontal position of the center of mass (COM). Subjects stood on a force plate and performed whole-body rhythmic movements for 45 s under visual feedback on one of the four variables, the position of the center of pressure or the angle in one of the three joints (ankle, knee, or hip). The Fitts-like paradigm was used with two target amplitudes and six indices of difficulty (ID) for each of the four variables. This was done to explore the robustness of kinematic postural synergies. A speed-accuracy trade-off was observed in all feedback conditions such that the movement time scaled with ID and the scaling differed between the two movement amplitudes. Principal-component (PC) analysis showed the existence of a single PC in the joint space that accounted for over 95\% of the joint angle variance. Analysis within the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis has shown that data distributions in the joint angle space were compatible with stabilization of both trunk orientation and COM location. We conclude that trunk orientation and the COM location are stabilized by co-varied changes of the major joint angles during whole-body movements. Despite the strong effects of movement amplitude and ID on performance, the structure of the joint variance showed only minor dependence on these task parameters. The two kinematic synergies (co-varied changes in the joint angles that stabilized the COM location and trunk orientation) have proven to be robust over a variety of tasks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {How the central nervous system (CNS) controls many joints and muscles is a fundamental question in motor neuroscience and related research areas. An attractive hypothesis is the module hypothesis: the CNS controls groups of joints or muscles (i.e., spatial modules) while providing time-varying motor commands (i.e., temporal modules) to the spatial modules rather than controlling each joint or muscle separately. Another fundamental question is how the CNS generates numerous repertories of movement patterns. One hypothesis is that the CNS modulates the spatial and/or temporal modules depending on the required tasks. It is thus essential to quantify the spatial module, the temporal module, and the task-dependent modulation of those modules. Although previous methods attempted to quantify these aspects, they considered the modulation in only the spatial or temporal module. These limitations were possibly due to the constraints inherent to conventional methods for quantifying the spatial and temporal modules. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of tensor decomposition in quantifying the spatial module, the temporal module, and the task-dependent modulation of these modules without such limitations. We further demonstrate that the tensor decomposition provides a new perspective on the task-dependent modulation of spatiotemporal modules: in switching from walking to running, the CNS modulates the peak timing in the temporal module while recruiting proximal muscles in the corresponding spatial module.

Author summary There are at least two fundamental questions in motor neuroscience and related research areas: 1) how does the central nervous system (CNS) control many joints and muscles and 2) how does the CNS generate numerous repertories of movement patterns. One possible answer to question 1) is that the CNS controls groups of joints or muscles (i.e., spatial modules) while providing time-varying motor commands (i.e., temporal modules) to the spatial modules rather than controlling each joint or muscle separately. One possible answer to question 2) is that the CNS modulates the spatial and/or temporal module depending on the required tasks. It is thus essential to quantify the spatial module, the temporal module, and the task-dependent modulation of those modules. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of tensor decomposition in quantifying those modules while overcoming the shortcomings inherent to previous methods. We further show that the tensor decomposition provides a new perspective on how the CNS switches between walking and running.

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.001},
	abstract = {Anatomically realistic volume conductor models of the human head are important for accurate forward modeling of the electric field during transcranial brain stimulation (TBS), electro- (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In particular, the skull compartment exerts a strong influence on the field distribution due to its low conductivity, suggesting the need to represent its geometry accurately. However, automatic skull reconstruction from structural magnetic resonance (MR) images is difficult, as compact bone has a very low signal in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we evaluate three methods for skull segmentation, namely FSL BET2, the unified segmentation routine of SPM12 with extended spatial tissue priors, and the skullfinder tool of BrainSuite. To our knowledge, this study is the first to rigorously assess the accuracy of these state-of-the-art tools by comparison with CT-based skull segmentations on a group of ten subjects. We demonstrate several key factors that improve the segmentation quality, including the use of multi-contrast MRI data, the optimization of the MR sequences and the adaptation of the parameters of the segmentation methods. We conclude that FSL and SPM12 achieve better skull segmentations than BrainSuite. The former methods obtain reasonable results for the upper part of the skull when a combination of T1- and T2-weighted images is used as input. The SPM12-based results can be improved slightly further by means of simple morphological operations to fix local defects. In contrast to FSL BET2, the SPM12-based segmentation with extended spatial tissue priors and the BrainSuite-based segmentation provide coarse reconstructions of the vertebrae, enabling the construction of volume conductor models that include the neck. We exemplarily demonstrate that the extended models enable a more accurate estimation of the electric field distribution during transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for montages that involve extraencephalic electrodes. The methods provided by FSL and SPM12 are integrated into pipelines for the automatic generation of realistic head models based on tetrahedral meshes, which are distributed as part of the open-source software package SimNIBS for field calculations for transcranial brain stimulation.},

	abstract = {Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) corticospinal excitability maps are a valuable tool to study plasticity in the corticospinal tract. Traditionally, data acquisition for a single map is time consuming, limiting the method's applicability when excitability changes quickly, such as during motor learning, and in clinical investigations where assessment time is a limiting factor. Objective: To reduce the time needed to create a reliable map by 1) investigating the minimum interstimulus interval (ISI) at which stimuli may be delivered, and 2) investigating the minimum number of stimuli required to create a map. Method: Frameless stereotaxy was used to monitor coil position as the coil was moved pseudorandomly within a 6 × 6 cm square. Maps were acquired using 1-4 s ISIs in 12 participants. The minimum number of stimuli was determined by randomly extracting data and comparing the resulting map to the original data set. To confirm validity, the pseudorandom walk method was compared against a traditional mapping method. Results: Reliable maps could be created with 63 stimuli recorded with a 1 s ISI. Maps created acquiring data using the pseudorandom walk method were not significantly different from maps acquired following the traditional method. Conclusions: To account for inter-participant variability, outliers, coil positioning errors and, most importantly, participant comfort during data acquisition, we recommend creating a map with 80 stimuli and a 1.5 s ISI. This makes it possible to acquire TMS maps in 2 min, making mapping a more feasible tool to study short- and long-term changes in cortical organization.},

	abstract = {The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on motor cortical excitability are highly variable between individuals. Inter-individual differences in the electric fields generated in the brain by tDCS might play a role in the variability. Here, we explored whether these fields are related to excitability changes following anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured in 28 healthy subjects before and after 20 min sham or 1 mA anodal tDCS of right M1 in a double-blind crossover design. The electric fields were individually modelled based on magnetic resonance images. Statistical analysis indicated that the variability in the MEPs could be partly explained by the electric fields, subjects with the weakest and strongest fields tending to produce opposite changes in excitability. To explain the findings, we hypothesized that the likely locus of action was in the hand area of M1, and the effective electric field component was that in the direction normal to the cortical surface. Our results demonstrate that a large part of inter-individual variability in tDCS may be due to differences in the electric fields. If this is the case, electric field dosimetry could be useful for controlling the neuroplastic effects of tDCS.},

	abstract = {Background: We address the problem of selecting and assessing classification and regression models using cross-validation. Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. Methods. We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. Results: We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. Conclusions: We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error. © 2014 Krstajic et al.; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The spatial extent of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is of paramount interest for all studies employing this method. It is generally assumed that the induced electric field is the crucial parameter to determine which cortical regions are excited. While it is difficult to directly measure the electric field, one usually relies on computational models to estimate the electric field distribution. Direct electrical stimulation (DES) is a local brain stimulation method generally considered the gold standard to map structure-function relationships in the brain. Its application is typically limited to patients undergoing brain surgery. In this study we compare the computationally predicted stimulation area in TMS with the DES area in six patients with tumors near precentral regions. We combine a motor evoked potential (MEP) mapping experiment for both TMS and DES with realistic individual finite element method (FEM) simulations of the electric field distribution during TMS and DES. On average, stimulation areas in TMS and DES show an overlap of up to 80\%, thus validating our computational physiology approach to estimate TMS excitation volumes. Our results can help in understanding the spatial spread of TMS effects and in optimizing stimulation protocols to more specifically target certain cortical regions based on computational modeling. © 2014 The Authors.

	abstract = {Recent evidence indicates subject-specific gyral folding patterns and white matter anisotropy uniquely shape electric fields generated by TMS. Current methods for predicting the brain regions influenced by TMS involve projecting the TMS coil position or center of gravity onto realistic head models derived from structural and functional imaging data. Similarly, spherical models have been used to estimate electric field distributions generated by TMS pulses delivered from a particular coil location and position. In the present paper we inspect differences between electric field computations estimated using the finite element method (FEM) and projection-based approaches described above. We then more specifically examined an approach for estimating cortical excitation volumes based on individualistic FEM simulations of electric fields. We evaluated this approach by performing neurophysiological recordings during MR-navigated motormapping experiments. We recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to single pulse TMS using two different coil orientations (45° and 90° to midline) at 25 different locations (5×5 grid, 1cm spacing) centered on the hotspot of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in left motor cortex. We observed that motor excitability maps varied within and between subjects as a function of TMS coil position and orientation. For each coil position and orientation tested, simulations of the TMS-induced electric field were computed using individualistic FEM models and compared to MEP amplitudes obtained during our motormapping experiments. We found FEM simulations of electric field strength, which take into account subject-specific gyral geometry and tissue conductivity anisotropy, significantly correlated with physiologically observed MEP amplitudes (rmax=0.91, p=1.8×10-5 rmean=0.81, p=0.01). These observations validate the implementation of individualistic FEM models to account for variations in gyral folding patterns and tissue conductivity anisotropy, which should help improve the targeting accuracy of TMS in the mapping or modulation of human brain circuits. © 2013 The Authors.},

Although it is well known that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) excites cerebral cortex in an orientation-selective manner, a neurophysiologically compelling explanation of this phenomenon has been lacking. It is generally presumed that TMS-induced excitation is mediated by horizontal fibers in the cortical surfaces nearest to the stimulating coil, i.e., at the gyral crowns. No evidence exists, however, that horizontal fibers are orientation selective either anatomically or physiologically. We used positron emission tomography to demonstrate that TMS-induced cortical activation is selectively sulcal. This observation allows the well-established columnar organization of cerebral cortex to be invoked to explain the observed orientation selectivity. In addition, Rushton's cosine principle can used to model stimulation efficacy for an electrical field applied at any cortical site at any intensity and in any orientation. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We especially show that force-related motor synergies exist, i.e. that muscle activation during grasping, as described by the sEMG signal, can be grouped synergistically; that these synergies are largely comparable to one another across human subjects notwithstanding the disturbances and inaccuracies typical of sEMG; and that they are physiologically feasible representations of muscular activity during grasping.

	abstract = {Controlling the movement of the arm to achieve a goal, such as reaching for an object, is challenging because it requires coordinating many muscles acting on many joints. The central nervous system might simplify the control of reaching by directly mapping initial states and goals into muscle activations through the combination of muscle synergies, coordinated recruitment of groups of muscles with specific activation profiles. Here we review recent results from the analysis of reaching muscle patterns supporting such a control strategy. Muscle patterns for point-to-point movements can be reconstructed by the combination of a small number of time-varying muscle synergies, modulated in amplitude and timing according to movement directions and speeds. Moreover, the modulation and superposition of the synergies identified from point-to-point movements captures the muscle patterns underlying multi-phasic movements, such as reaching through a via-point or to a target whose location changes after movement initiation. Thus, the sequencing of time-varying muscle synergies might implement an intermittent controller which would allow the construction of complex movements from simple building blocks. © 2013 D\_avella and Lacquaniti.},

	abstract = {How the CNS selects the appropriate muscle patterns to achieve a behavioral goal is an open question. To gain insight into this process, we characterized the spatiotemporal organization of the muscle patterns for fast-reaching movements. We recorded electromyographic activity from up to 19 shoulder and arm muscles during point-to-point movements between a central location and 8 peripheral targets in each of 2 vertical planes. We used an optimization algorithm to identify a set of time-varying muscle synergies, i.e., the coordinated activations of groups of muscles with specific time-varying profiles. For each one of nine subjects, we extracted four or five synergies whose combinations, after scaling in amplitude and shifting in time each synergy independently for each movement condition, explained 73-82\% of the data variation. We then tested whether these synergies could reconstruct the muscle patterns for point-to-point movements with different loads or forearm postures and for reversal and via-point movements. We found that reconstruction accuracy remained high, indicating generalization across these conditions. Finally, the synergy amplitude coefficients were directionally tuned according to a cosine function with a preferred direction that showed a smaller variability with changes of load, posture, and endpoint than the preferred direction of individual muscles. Thus the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of the muscles patterns for reaching were captured by the combinations of a small number of components, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in the generation of the muscle patterns exploit this low dimensionality to simplify control.

So far, however, use of the method in man has been restricted by the necessity of opening the skull surgically to apply the electrodes. Much could be done, both with healthy subjects and with neurological patients, if it were feasible to stimulate through electrodes on the scalp, although the localization of the stimulus on the cortex will always be much less sharp than with electrodes on the brain surface. In an intact man, however, the brain is protected from electricity by the skull and by the scalp, both of which normally offer considerable resistance. Furthermore, the cerebral cortex does not have a particularly low electrical threshold. It is probably for these reasons (despite an occasional contrary claim1) that attempts to stimulate the brain by applying stimuli from conventional stimulators to the scalp have been stopped by pain or have otherwise failed. These obstacles have now begun to yield. Recently, it was found that, on stimulating muscles in the human hand2 without any special preparation of the skin, the effective resistance fell to low values if brief but very high voltage shocks were used. Applying the same technique to the head, it has now proved possible at the first attempt to stimulate two areas of the human cortex, without undue discomfort. © 1980 Nature Publishing Group.},

Over the past decade the scientific and medical community has had the opportunity to evaluate the safety record of research studies and clinical applications of TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS). In these years the number of applications of conventional TMS has grown impressively, new paradigms of stimulation have been developed (e.g., patterned repetitive TMS) and technical advances have led to new device designs and to the real-time integration of TMS with electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thousands of healthy subjects and patients with various neurological and psychiatric diseases have undergone TMS allowing a better assessment of relative risks. The occurrence of seizures (i.e., the most serious TMS-related acute adverse effect) has been extremely rare, with most of the few new cases receiving rTMS exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients under treatment with drugs which potentially lower the seizure threshold. The present updated guidelines review issues of risk and safety of conventional TMS protocols, address the undesired effects and risks of emerging TMS interventions, the applications of TMS in patients with implanted electrodes in the central nervous system, and safety aspects of TMS in neuroimaging environments. We cover recommended limits of stimulation parameters and other important precautions, monitoring of subjects, expertise of the rTMS team, and ethical issues.

	abstract = {Muscle synergies have been used for decades to explain a variety of motor behaviors, both in humans and animals and, more recently, to steer rehabilitation strategies. However, many sources of variability such as factorization algorithms, criteria for dimensionality reduction and data pre-processing constitute a major obstacle to the successful comparison of the results obtained by different research groups. Starting from the canonical EMG processing we determined how variations in filter cut-off frequencies and normalization methods, commonly found in literature, affect synergy weights and inter-subject similarity (ISS) using experimental data related to a 15-muscles upper-limb reaching task. Synergy weights were not significantly altered by either normalization (maximum voluntary contraction - MVC - or maximum amplitude of the signal - SELF) or band-pass filter ([20-500 Hz] or [50-500] Hz). Normalization did, however, alter the amount of variance explained by a set of synergies, which is a criterion often used for model order selection. Comparing different low-pass (LP) filters (0.5 Hz, 4 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz cut-offs) we showed that increasing the low pass filter cut-off had the effect of decreasing the variance accounted for by a set number of synergies and affected individual muscle contributions. Extreme smoothing (i.e., LP cut-off 0.5 Hz) enhanced the contrast between active and inactive muscles but had an unpredictable effect on the ISS. The results presented here constitute a further step towards a thoughtful EMG pre-processing for the extraction of muscle synergies.},

The segment of the precentral gyrus that most often contained motor hand function was a knob-like structure, that is shaped like an omega or epsilon in the axial plane and like a hook in the sagittal plane. On the cortical surface of cadaver specimens this precentral knob corresponded precisely to the characteristic 'middle knee' of the central sulcus that has been described by various anatomists in the last century. We were then able to show that this knob is a reliable landmark for identifying the precentral gyrus directly. We therefore conclude that neural elements involved in motor hand function are located in a characteristic 'precentral knob' which is a reliable landmark for identifying the precentral gyrus under normal and pathological conditions. It faces and forms the 'middle knee' of the central sulcus, is located just at the cross point between the precentral sulcus and the central sulcus, and is therefore also visible on the cortical surface.},

However, the three-dimensional (3-D) anatomic boundaries between these regions remain unclear.

We then computed the probability distributions describing the likelihood of activation, and characterized the shape, extent, and area of each sensorimotor region in 3-D. Additionally, we evaluated the nature of the overlap between the six sensorimotor regions.

	abstract = {Purpose To validate a novel setup for concurrent TMS/fMRI in the human motor cortex based on a dedicated, ultra-thin, multichannel receive MR coil positioned between scalp and TMS system providing greatly enhanced sensitivity compared to the standard birdcage coil setting. Methods A combined TMS/fMRI design was applied over the primary motor cortex based on 1 Hz stimulation with stimulation levels of 80\%, 90\%, 100\%, and 110\% of the individual active motor threshold, respectively. Due to the use of a multichannel receive coil we were able to use multiband-accelerated (MB=2) EPI sequences for the acquisition of functional images. Data were analysed with SPM12 and BOLD-weighted signal intensity time courses were extracted in each subject from two local maxima (individual functional finger tapping localiser, fixed MNI coordinate of the hand knob) next to the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and from the global maximum. Results We report excellent image quality without noticeable signal dropouts or image distortions. Parameter estimates in the three peak voxels showed monotonically ascending activation levels over increasing stimulation intensities. Across all subjects, mean BOLD signal changes for 80\%, 90\%, 100\%, 110\% of the individual active motor threshold were 0.43\%, 0.63\%, 1.01\%, 2.01\% next to the individual functional finger tapping maximum, 0.73\%, 0.91\%, 1.34\%, 2.21\% next to the MNI-defined hand knob and 0.88\%, 1.09\%, 1.65\%, 2.77\% for the global maximum, respectively. Conclusion Our results show that the new setup for concurrent TMS/fMRI experiments using a dedicated MR coil array allows for high-sensitivity fMRI particularly at the site of stimulation. Contrary to the standard birdcage approach, the results also demonstrate that the new coil can be successfully used for multiband-accelerated EPI acquisition. The gain in flexibility due to the new coil can be easily combined with neuronavigation within the MR scanner to allow for accurate targeting in TMS/fMRI experiments.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) causes a complex spatial distribution of the electric current flow in the head which hampers the accurate localization of the stimulated brain areas. In this study we show how various anatomical features systematically shape the electric field distribution in the brain during tDCS. We constructed anatomically realistic finite element (FEM) models of two individual heads including conductivity anisotropy and different skull layers. We simulated a widely employed electrode montage to induce motor cortex plasticity and moved the stimulating electrode over the motor cortex in small steps to examine the resulting changes of the electric field distribution in the underlying cortex. We examined the effect of skull thickness and composition on the passing currents showing that thinner skull regions lead to higher electric field strengths. This effect is counteracted by a larger proportion of higher conducting spongy bone in thicker regions leading to a more homogenous current over the skull. Using a multiple regression model we could identify key factors that determine the field distribution to a significant extent, namely the thicknesses of the cerebrospinal fluid and the skull, the gyral depth and the distance to the anode and cathode. These factors account for up to 50\% of the spatial variation of the electric field strength. Further, we demonstrate that individual anatomical factors can lead to stimulation "hotspots" which are partly resistant to electrode positioning. Our results give valuable novel insights in the biophysical foundation of tDCS and highlight the importance to account for individual anatomical factors when choosing an electrode montage},

The current density magnitude correlated to the conductivity of the tissue in all the cases tested except where the tissue permittivity was raised to a level to allow for displacement currents. In this case, the permittivity of the tissue was the dominant factor. Current density components normal to the tissue interface were shown to exist in all solutions within the cortex contrary to the predictions of present models that rely on symmetrical geometries. Additionally, modifications in the cortical geometry were shown to perturb the field so that the site of activation could be altered in diseased patient populations.

	abstract = {Objective: To compare two commonly used TMS coils, namely the Medtronic MC-B70 double coil and the Magstim 70 mm double coil, with respect to their electric field distributions induced on the cortex. Methods: Electric field properties are calculated on a hemisphere representing the cortex using a spherical head model. The coil designs are characterised using several parameters, such as focality, efficiency and stimulation depth. Results: Medtronic and Magstim coils exhibit similar focality values and stimulation depths, despite very different coil designs. However, the Medtronic coil is about 1.2 times more efficient compared to the Magstim coil. This difference corresponds to different motor and visual phosphene thresholds obtained in previous physiological studies, thereby validating the chosen coil modelling approach. Focality of the Medtronic coil changed less with varying coil-cortex distance compared to the Magstim coil, whereas both coils exhibited similar dependencies on changes in cortex radius. Conclusions: The similar values for focality and stimulation depth indicate that both coil types should evoke similar physiological effects when adjusting for the different efficiencies. The different physiological thresholds of the two coils can be traced back to differences in coil design. Ideally, focality should depend neither on coil-cortex distance nor on cortex radius in order to allow for an inter-subject comparability. In particular, in motor mapping experiments the size of the resulting maps is affected by these two parameters. Consequently, they are at least partially the cause of the variability across subjects seen in these experiments. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Principal components extracted from TMS-induced finger movements resembled those derived from end-postures of voluntary movements performed to grasp imagined objects, and a small subset of them was sufficient to reconstruct these movements with remarkable fidelity.

Knowledge of the spatial distributions of these induced electric fields and currents in the tissues is very limited because of the complex geometry and inhomogeneous, anisotropic conductivities of the tissues, as well as the spatial nonuniformity of the applied magnetic fields. In this paper, we present a finite element solution method that can be used to compute the induced electric field and current density distributions in tissues when the time rate of change of the applied magnetic field is low enough that the propagation time and magnetic diffusion time in the conductive tissues are negligible, and when the conduction current in the tissues is substantially larger than the displacement current. This finite element implementation is tested for some simple conductive models with both spatially uniform and nonuniform magnetic fields. Our solutions for a homogeneous isotropic conductive slab and a homogeneous anisotropic conductive slab exposed to a uniform magnetic field are in good agreement with analytical results. The finite element approach enables us to include conductive inhomogeneity and anisotropy. It allows us to closely model the complex geometry of the tissues. Therefore, it is well suited for realistic models of the conductive anatomy of biological tissues. © 1994, American Institute of Physics},

is known to be non-uniform with most M1 neurons having broad tuning
functions for multiple fingers. Evidence for multi-muscle representations
in M1, often labeled as motor primitives or synergies, is strongly supported
by neurophysiological stimulation-recordings in non-human animal species.
The most practical way to carry out such studies non-invasively in
humans is to use transcranial stimulation to map representations in the
motor system. Of the available techniques, the most attractive at this time
is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as it offers the best tradeoff
among resolution, depth of penetration, and accurate targeting. However,
traditional TMS map construction does not take into account how stimulation
is dispersed throughout individual cortical geometry and physiology.
In this study, we describe methodology to generate maps of cortical
activation leveraging recent advances in cortical field (E-Field) modeling.
We conducted a TMS (Magstim D702
) mapping experiment targeting 16
muscles of the hand/forearm using a novel non-gridded mapping
approach. Anatomical MRI was used to derive a subject specific headmodeled
mesh with electrical conductivities assigned to the mesh elements
based on known tissue properties. The software BrainStimulator
(SCIRun5) was utilized to compute induced electrical currents for each

algorithms for relating the size of the motor evoked potential to the

	abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool for the electrical stimulation of neural tissue, including cerebral cortex, spinal roots, and cranial and peripheral nerves. TMS can be applied as single pulses of stimulation, pairs of stimuli separated by variable intervals to the same or different brain areas, or as trains of repetitive stimuli at various frequencies. Single stimuli can depolarise neurons and evoke measurable effects. Trains of stimuli (repetitive TMS) can modify excitability of the cerebral cortex at the stimulated site and also at remote areas along functional anatomical connections. TMS might provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the neural circuitry underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders, be developed into clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic tests, and have therapeutic uses in various diseases. This potential is supported by the available studies, but more work is needed to establish the role of TMS in clinical neurology.},

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience. © 2008 Kriegeskorte, Mur and Bandettini.},

	abstract = {Objective: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation (TES) modulate brain activity non-invasively by generating electric fields either by electromagnetic induction or by injecting currents via skin electrodes. Numerical simulations based on anatomically detailed head models of the TMS and TES electric fields can help us to understand and optimize the spatial stimulation pattern in the brain. However, most realistic simulations are still slow, and their numerical accuracy and the factors that influence it have not been evaluated in detail so far. Approach: We present and validate a new implementation of the Finite Element Method (FEM) for TMS and TES that is based on modern algorithms and libraries. We also evaluate the convergence of the simulations and give estimates for the discretization errors. Main results: Comparisons with analytical solutions for spherical head models validate our new FEM implementation. It is five to ten times faster than previous implementations. The convergence results suggest that accurately capturing the tissue geometry in addition to choosing a sufficiently high mesh density is of fundamental importance for accurate simulations. Significance: The new implementation allows for a substantial increase in computational efficiency of TMS and TES simulations. This is especially relevant for applications such as the systematic assessment of model uncertainty and the optimization of multi-electrode TES montages. The results of our systematic error analysis allow the user to select the best tradeoff between model resolution and simulation speed for a specific application. The new FEM code will be made openly available as a part of our open-source software SimNIBS 3.0.},

	abstract = {The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with functional neuroimaging has expanded the potential of TMS for human brain mapping. The precise and reliable positioning of the TMS coil is not a simple task, however. Modern frameless stereotaxic systems allow investigators to base navigation either on the subject's structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI data, or the use of functional neuroimaging data from the literature, so-called "probabilistic approach." The latter assumes consistency across individuals in the location of task-related "activations" in standardized stereotaxic space. Conventional nonstereotaxic localization of brain areas is also a common method for defining the coil position. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of five different localization strategies in one single study. The left primary motor cortex (left M1-Hand) was used as target region. Three approaches were based on real-time frameless stereotaxy using information based on either anatomical or functional MRI. The remaining two strategies relied either on standard cranial landmarks (i.e., the International 10-20 EEG system) or a standardized function-guided procedure (i.e., the spatial relationship between the left and right M1-Hand). The results were compared to a TMS-based mapping of the primary motor cortex; center of gravity of motor-evoked potentials (MEP-CoG) was calculated for each subject (n = 10). Our findings suggest that highest precision can be achieved with fMRI-guided stimulation, which was accurate within the range of millimeters. Very consistent results were also obtained with the "probabilistic" approach. In view of these findings, we discuss the methods and special characteristics of each localization strategy.},

Maps of different muscles, which are functionally coupled, may present with a large overlap but may also show a relevant variability. On the other hand, stimulation of the motor cortex at one spot with different stimulation intensities results in a characteristic input-output (IO) curve for one specific muscle but may simultaneously also activate different, functionally coupled muscles. A comparison of the cortical map overlap of synergistic muscles and their IO curves has not yet been carried out. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to probe functional synergies of forearm muscles with transcranial magnetic stimulation by harnessing the convergence and divergence of the corticospinal output. METHODS We acquired bihemispheric cortical maps and IO curves of the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor carpi radialis, and extensor digitorum communis muscles by subjecting 11 healthy subjects to both monophasic and biphasic pulse waveforms. RESULTS The degree of synergy between pairs of forearm muscles was captured by the overlap of the cortical motor maps and the respective IO curves which were influenced by the pulse waveform. Monophasic and biphasic stimulation were particularly suitable for disentangling synergistic muscles in the right and left hemisphere, respectively. CONCLUSION Combining IO curves and different pulse waveforms may provide complementary information on neural circuit dynamics and corticospinal recruitment patterns of synergistic muscles and their neuroplastic modulation.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the precise cortical location underlying the physiological and behavioral stimulation effects are still only coarsely known. So far, mapping strategies rely on center of gravity approaches and therefore localize the stimulated cortical site only approximately and indirectly. Focusing on the motor cortex, we present a novel method to reliably determine the effectively stimulated cortical site at the individual subject level. The approach combines measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at different coil positions and orientations with numerical modeling of induced electric fields. We identify sharply bounded cortical areas around the gyral crowns and rims of the motor hand area as the origin of MEPs and show that the tangential component and the magnitude of the electric field is most relevant for the observed effect. To validate our approach, we determined motor thresholds for coil positions and orientations for the predicted cortical target. Our methods allows for the identification of optimal coil positions and orientations. Moreover, we used extensive uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of the method and identify the most critical model parameters. Our generic approach improves the localization of the cortex area stimulated by TMS and may be transferred to other modalities such as language mapping.},

However, characterization of the accuracy of the simulation methods and the factors that affect it is lacking. OBJECTIVE To ensure the accuracy of TMS E-field simulations, we systematically quantify their numerical error and provide guidelines for their setup. METHOD We benchmark the accuracy of computational approaches that are commonly used for TMS E-field simulations, including the finite element method (FEM) with and without superconvergent patch recovery (SPR), boundary element method (BEM), finite difference method (FDM), and coil modeling methods. RESULTS To achieve cortical E-field error levels below 2\%, the commonly used FDM and 1st order FEM require meshes with an average edge length below 0.4 mm, 1st order SPR-FEM requires edge lengths below 0.8 mm, and BEM and 2nd (or higher) order FEM require edge lengths below 2.9 mm. Coil models employing magnetic and current dipoles require at least 200 and 3000 dipoles, respectively. For thick solid-conductor coils and frequencies above 3 kHz, winding eddy currents may have to be modeled. CONCLUSION BEM, FDM, and FEM all converge to the same solution. Compared to the common FDM and 1st order FEM approaches, BEM and 2nd (or higher) order FEM require significantly lower mesh densities to achieve the same error level. In some cases, coil winding eddy-currents must be modeled. Both electric current dipole and magnetic dipole models of the coil current can be accurate with sufficiently fine discretization.},

	abstract = {Several recent studies have used matrix factorization algorithms to assess the hypothesis that behaviors might be produced through the combination of a small number of muscle synergies. Although generally agreeing in their basic conclusions, these studies have used a range of different algorithms, making their interpretation and integration difficult. We therefore compared the performance of these different algorithms on both simulated and experimental data sets. We focused on the ability of these algorithms to identify the set of synergies underlying a data set. All data sets consisted of nonnegative values, reflecting the nonnegative data of muscle activation patterns. We found that the performance of principal component analysis (PCA) was generally lower than that of the other algorithms in identifying muscle synergies. Factor analysis (FA) with varimax rotation was better than PCA, and was generally at the same levels as independent component analysis (ICA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). ICA performed very well on data sets corrupted by constant variance Gaussian noise, but was impaired on data sets with signal-dependent noise and when synergy activation coefficients were correlated. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) performed similarly to ICA and FA on data sets with signal-dependent noise and was generally robust across data sets. The best algorithms were ICA applied to the subspace defined by PCA (ICAPCA) and a version of probabilistic ICA with nonnegativity constraints (pICA). We also evaluated some commonly used criteria to identify the number of synergies underlying a data set, finding that only likelihood ratios based on factor analysis identified the correct number of synergies for data sets with signal-dependent noise in some cases. We then proposed an ad hoc procedure, finding that it was able to identify the correct number in a larger number of cases. Finally, we applied these methods to an experimentally obtained data set. The best performing algorithms (FA, ICA, NMF, ICAPCA, pICA) identified synergies very similar to one another. Based on these results, we discuss guidelines for using factorization algorithms to analyze muscle activation patterns. More generally, the ability of several algorithms to identify the correct muscle synergies and activation coefficients in simulated data, combined with their consistency when applied to physiological data sets, suggests that the muscle synergies found by a particular algorithm are not an artifact of that algorithm, but reflect basic aspects of the organization of muscle activation patterns underlying behaviors.},

To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a new method to extract invariant spatiotemporal components from the simultaneous recordings of the activity of many muscles. We used this technique to analyze the muscle patterns of intact and unrestrained frogs during kicking, a natural defensive behavior. Here we show that combinations of three time-varying muscle synergies underlie the variety of muscle patterns required to kick in different directions, that the recruitment of these synergies is related to movement kinematics, and that there are similarities among the synergies extracted from different behaviors.},

The volleys were compared with D waves evoked by anodal electrical stimulation (two subjects) or medio-lateral magnetic stimulation (two subjects). As reported previously, PA stimulation preferentially recruited I1 waves, with later I waves appearing at higher stimulus intensities. AP stimulation tended to recruit later I waves (I3 waves) in one of the subjects, but, in the other three, I1 or D waves were seen. Unexpectedly, the descending volleys evoked by AP stimulation often had slightly different peak latencies and/or longer duration than those seen after PA stimulation. In addition the relationship between the size of the descending volleys and the subsequent EMG response was often different for AP and PA stimulation. These findings suggest that AP stimulation does not simply activate a subset of the sites activated by PA stimulation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Despite recent developments in navigation and modeling techniques, the type and location of the structures that are activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) remain unknown. 

OBJECTIVE
We studied the relationships between electrophysiological measurements and electric fields induced in the brain to locate the TMS activation site. 

METHODS
The active and resting motor thresholds of the first dorsal interosseous muscle were recorded in 19 subjects (7 female, 12 male, age 22 ± 4 years) using anteromedially oriented monophasic TMS at multiple locations over the left primary motor cortex (M1). Structural MR images were used to construct electric field models of each subject's head and brain. The cortical activation site was estimated by finding where the calculated electric fields best explained the coil-location dependency of the measured MTs. 

RESULTS
The experiments and modeling showed individual variations both in the measured motor thresholds (MTs) and in the computed electric fields. When the TMS coil was moved on the scalp, the calculated electric fields in the hand knob region were shown to vary consistently with the measured MTs. Group-level analysis indicated that the electric fields were significantly correlated with the measured MTs. The strongest correlations (R2 = 0.69), which indicated the most likely activation site, were found in the ventral and lateral part of the hand knob. The site was independent of voluntary contractions of the target muscle. 

CONCLUSION
The study showed that TMS combined with personalized electric field modeling can be used for high-resolution mapping of the motor cortex.},

We use the finite element method (FEM) and magnetic resonance image-based individual head models to get realistic estimates of the electric field induced by TMS. The field changes in different subparts of the motor cortex are compared with electrophysiological threshold changes of 2 hand muscles when systematically varying the coil orientation in measurements. We demonstrate that TMS stimulates the region around the gyral crown and that the maximal electric field strength in this region is significantly related to the electrophysiological response. Our study is one of the most extensive comparisons between FEM-based field calculations and physiological TMS effects so far, being based on data for 2 hand muscles in 9 subjects. The results help to improve our understanding of the basic mechanisms of TMS. They also pave the way for a systematic exploration of realistic field estimates for dosage control in TMS.},

	abstract = {The motor-evoked potential (MEP) elicited in peripheral muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over human motor cortex is one of the hallmark measures for non-invasive quantification of cortical and spinal excitability in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. In the present article, we distinguish three main uses for MEPs in studies of behaviour: for understanding execution and performance of actions, as markers of physiological change in the motor system, and as read-out of upstream processes influencing the motor system. Common to all three approaches is the assumption that different experimental manipulations act on the balance of excitatory and inhibitory pre-synaptic (inter)neurons at the stimulation site; this in turn contributes to levels of (post-synaptic) excitability of cortico-spinal output projections, which ultimately determines the size of MEPs recorded from peripheral muscles. We discuss the types of inference one can draw from human MEP measures given that the detailed physiological underpinnings of MEPs elicited by TMS are complex and remain incompletely understood. Awareness of the different mechanistic assumptions underlying different uses of MEPs can help inform both study design and interpretation of results obtained from human MEP studies of behaviour.},

In the early days, it was primarily used to test integrity of the corticospinal tract. Beyond further developments of TMS in diagnostics, mapping and monitoring of the motor system, major other applications expanded into using TMS as research tool in the cognitive neurosciences, and as therapeutic tool in neurological and psychiatric disease by virtue of inducing long-term change in excitability and connectivity of the stimulated brain networks. This mini-review will highlight these developments by reviewing the 10 most frequently cited TMS publications. Despite the tremendous popularity and success of TMS as a non-invasive technique to stimulate the human brain, several aims remain unresolved. This review will end with highlighting those 10 most frequently cited papers that have been published in 2014-2016 to indicate the currently hottest topics in TMS research and major avenues of development.},

	abstract = {Objective: Motor recovery after stroke is attributed to neuronal plasticity, however not all post-stroke neuronal changes relate to regaining fine motor control. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) is a measure allowing to trace neuronal reorganizations which are functionally relevant for motor recovery. Contrary to previous studies which were performed only in chronic stage, we measured CMC in patients with stroke at both acute and chronic stroke stages. Methods: For the detection of CMC we used multichannel EEG and EMG recordings along with an optimization algorithm for the detection of corticomuscular interactions. Results: In acute stroke, the CMC amplitude was larger on the unaffected side compared to the affected side and also larger compared to the unaffected side in the chronic period. Additionally, CMC peak frequencies on both sides decreased in the acute compared to the chronic period and to control subjects. In chronic stage, there were no inter-hemispheric or group differences in CMC amplitude or frequency. Conclusions: The changes in CMC parameters in acute stroke could result from a temporary decrease in inhibition, which normalizes in the course of recovery. As all patients showed very good motor recovery, the modulation of CMC amplitude and frequency over time might thus reflect the process of motor recovery. Significance: We demonstrate for the first time the dynamical changes of corticomuscular interaction both at acute and chronic stage of stroke. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

Integration of these novel approaches in clinical practice depends on the availability of reliable, simple, and sensitive biomarkers of impairment level and extent of recovery, to enable an informed clinical-decision process. However, the neuropsychological tests currently in use do not tap into the complex neural re-organization process that occurs after brain insult and its modulation by treatment. Here we show that topographical analysis of resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) patterns using singular value decomposition (SVD) could be used to capture these processes. In two groups of subacute stroke patients, we show reliable detection of deviant neurophysiological patterns over repeated measurement sessions on separate days. These patterns generalized across patients groups. Additionally, they maintained a significant association with ipsilesional attention bias, discriminating patients with spatial neglect of different severity levels. The sensitivity and reliability of these rsEEG topographical analyses support their use as a tool for monitoring natural and treatment-induced recovery in the rehabilitation process.},

	abstract = {In recent years, EEG microstate analysis has gained popularity as a tool to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics of large-scale electrophysiology data. It has been used in a wide range of EEG studies and the discovered microstates have been linked to cognitive function and brain diseases. EEG microstates are assumed to (1) be winner-take-all, meaning that the topography at any given time point is in one state; and (2) discretely transition from one state into another. In this study we investigated these assumptions by taking a geometric perspective of EEG data, treating microstate topographies as basis vectors for a subspace of the original channel space. We found that within- and across-microstate distance distributions were largely overlapping: for the low GFP (Global Field Power) range (lower 15\%), individual time points labeled as one microstate are often equidistant to multiple microstate vectors, challenging the winner-take-all assumption. At high global field power, separability of microstates improved, but remained rather weak. Although many GFP peaks (which are the time points used for defining microstates) occur during high GFP ranges, low GFP ranges associated with poor separability also contain GFP peaks. Furthermore, the geometric analysis suggested that microstates and their transitions appear to be more continuous than discrete. The Analysis of rate of change of trajectory in sensor space suggests gradual microstate transitions as opposed to the classical binary view of EEG microstates. Taken together, our findings suggest that EEG microstates are better conceptualized as spatially and temporally continuous, rather than discrete activations of neural populations.},

	abstract = {Objective: We investigated the ability of quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) measures in sub-acute stroke to assist monitoring or prognostication of stroke evolution. QEEG indices and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were compared. Methods: Ischaemic cortical stroke patients were studied. Resting, 62-channel EEG and NIHSS score were acquired at 49 ± 3 h post-symptom onset, and NIHSS administered at 30 ± 2 days post-stroke. Mean power was calculated for delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4.1-8 Hz), alpha (8.1-12.5 Hz) and beta (12.6-30 Hz) frequency bands, using a 62-channel electrode array and a 19-channel subset. Results: Thirteen patients (6 male, median age 66, range 54-86 years) were studied. Sub-acute delta:alpha power ratio (DAR; r = 0.91, P {\textless} 0.001), relative alpha power (r = -0.82, P {\textless} 0.01), and NIHSS score (r = 0.92, P {\textless} 0.001) each were significantly correlated with 30-day NIHSS score. The former two significant correlations were upheld in 19-channel EEG data. QEEG measures involving theta or beta power were not significantly correlated with NIHSS scores. Conclusions: QEEG measures such as DAR demonstrate potential to augment bedside assessment of cerebral pathophysiology and prognostication of stroke evolution. A standard, 19-channel array seems adequate for these purposes. Future studies in larger samples should investigate the potential effects on these measures of sleep state and possible causes of artefacts. Significance: QEEG measures from a standard number of electrodes, if available rapidly and robust to potential artefacts, may inform future management of stroke patients. © 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

	abstract = {Objective. This study aimed to produce a novel deep learning (DL) model for the classification of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and healthy ageing (HA) subjects using resting-state scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Approach. The raw EEG data were pre-processed to remove unwanted artefacts and sources of noise. The data were then processed with the continuous wavelet transform, using the Morse mother wavelet, to create time-frequency graphs with a wavelet coefficient scale range of 0–600. The graphs were combined into tiled topographical maps governed by the 10–20 system orientation for scalp electrodes. The application of this processing pipeline was used on a data set of resting-state EEG samples from age-matched groups of 52 AD subjects (82.3 ± 4.7 years of age), 37 MCI subjects (78.4 ± 5.1 years of age) and 52 HA subjects (79.6 ± 6.0 years of age). This resulted in the formation of a data set of 16197 topographical images. This image data set was then split into training, validation and test images and used as input to an AlexNet DL model. This model was comprised of five hidden convolutional layers and optimised for various parameters such as learning rate, learning rate schedule, optimiser, and batch size. Main results. The performance was assessed by a tenfold cross-validation strategy, which produced an average accuracy result of 98.9 ± 0.4\% for the three-class classification of AD vs MCI vs HA. The results showed minimal overfitting and bias between classes, further indicating the strength of the model produced. Significance. These results provide significant improvement for this classification task compared to previous studies in this field and suggest that DL could contribute to the diagnosis of AD from EEG recordings.},

	abstract = {Time series classification is related to many different domains, such as health informatics, finance, and bioinformatics. Due to its broad applications, researchers have developed many algorithms for this kind of tasks, e.g., multivariate time series classification. Among the classification algorithms, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification (particularly 1-NN) combined with dynamic time warping (DTW) achieves the state of the art performance. The deficiency is that when the data set grows large, the time consumption of 1-NN with DTWwill be very expensive. In contrast to 1-NN with DTW, it is more efficient but less effective for feature-based classification methods since their performance usually depends on the quality of hand-crafted features. In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches through the feature learning techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework, multi-channels deep convolutional neural networks (MC-DCNN), for multivariate time series classification. This model first learns features from individual univariate time series in each channel, and combines information from all channels as feature representation at the final layer. Then, the learnt features are applied into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification. Finally, the extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our model is not only more efficient than the state of the art but also competitive in accuracy. This study implies that feature learning is worth to be investigated for the problem of time series classification.},

Across eight experiments, participants were less likely to identify advantageous subtractive changes when the task did not (versus did) cue them to consider subtraction, when they had only one opportunity (versus several) to recognize the shortcomings of an additive search strategy or when they were under a higher (versus lower) cognitive load.

	abstract = {Background
The number of individuals living with dementia is increasing, negatively affecting families, communities, and health-care systems around the world. A successful response to these challenges requires an accurate understanding of the dementia disease burden. We aimed to present the first detailed analysis of the global prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of dementia as captured by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2016, and highlight the most important messages for clinicians and neurologists.
Methods
GBD 2016 obtained data on dementia from vital registration systems, published scientific literature and surveys, and data from health-service encounters on deaths, excess mortality, prevalence, and incidence from 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, through systematic review and additional data-seeking efforts. To correct for differences in cause of death coding across time and locations, we modelled mortality due to dementia using prevalence data and estimates of excess mortality derived from countries that were most likely to code deaths to dementia relative to prevalence. Data were analysed by standardised methods to estimate deaths, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; computed as the sum of YLLs and YLDs), and the fractions of these metrics that were attributable to four risk factors that met GBD criteria for assessment (high body-mass index [BMI], high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages).
Findings
In 2016, the global number of individuals who lived with dementia was 43·8 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 37·8–51·0), increased from 20.2 million (17·4–23·5) in 1990. This increase of 117\% (95\% UI 114–121) contrasted with a minor increase in age-standardised prevalence of 1·7\% (1·0–2·4), from 701 cases (95\% UI 602–815) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 712 cases (614–828) per 100 000 population in 2016. More women than men had dementia in 2016 (27·0 million, 95\% UI 23·3–31·4, vs 16.8 million, 14.4–19.6), and dementia was the fifth leading cause of death globally, accounting for 2·4 million (95\% UI 2·1–2·8) deaths. Overall, 28·8 million (95\% UI 24·5–34·0) DALYs were attributed to dementia; 6·4 million (95\% UI 3·4–10·5) of these could be attributed to the modifiable GBD risk factors of high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages.
Interpretation
The global number of people living with dementia more than doubled from 1990 to 2016, mainly due to increases in population ageing and growth. Although differences in coding for causes of death and the heterogeneity in case-ascertainment methods constitute major challenges to the estimation of the burden of dementia, future analyses should improve on the methods for the correction of these biases. Until breakthroughs are made in prevention or curative treatment, dementia will constitute an increasing challenge to health-care systems worldwide.

	abstract = {Most studies of continuous EEG data have used frequency transformation, which allows the quantification of brain states that vary over seconds. For the analysis of shorter, transient EEG events, it is possible to identify and quantify brain electric microstates as subsecond time epochs with stable field topography. These microstates may correspond to basic building blocks of human information processing. Microstate analysis yields a compact and comprehensive repertoire of short lasting classes of brain topographic maps, which may be considered to reflect global functional states. Each microstate class is described by topography, mean duration, frequency of occurrence and percentage analysis time occupied. This paper presents normative microstate data for resting EEG obtained from a database of 496 subjects between the age of 6 and 80 years. The extracted microstate variables showed a lawful, complex evolution with age. The pattern of changes with age is compatible with the existence of developmental stages as claimed by developmental psychologists. The results are discussed in the framework of state dependent information processing and suggest the existence of biologically predetermined top-down processes that bias brain electric activity to functional states appropriate for age-specific learning and behavior.},

	abstract = {New treatments for Alzheimer's disease require early detection of cognitive decline. Most studies seeking to identify markers of early cognitive decline have focused on a limited number of measures. We sought to establish the profile of brain function measures which best define early neuropsychological decline. We compared subjects with subjective memory complaints to normative controls on a wide range of EEG derived measures, including a new measure of event-related spatio-temporal waves and biophysical modeling, which derives anatomical and physiological parameters based on subject's EEG measurements. Measures that distinguished the groups were then related to cognitive performance on a variety of learning and executive function tasks. The EEG measures include standard power measures, peak alpha frequency, EEG desynchronization to eyes-opening, and global phase synchrony. The most prominent differences in subjective memory complaint subjects were elevated alpha power and an increased number of spatio-temporal wave events. Higher alpha power and changes in wave activity related most strongly to a decline in verbal memory performance in subjects with subjective memory complaints, and also declines in maze performance and working memory reaction time. Interestingly, higher alpha power and wave activity were correlated with improved performance in reverse digit span in the subjective memory complaint group. The modeling results suggest that differences in the subjective memory complaint subjects were due to a decrease in cortical and thalamic inhibitory gains and slowed dendritic time-constants. The complementary profile that emerges from the variety of measures and analyses points to a nonlinear progression in electrophysiological changes from early neuropsychological decline to late-stage dementia, and electrophysiological changes in subjective memory complaint that vary in their relationships to a range of memory-related tasks.},

	abstract = {The consideration of Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) as a preclinical stage of AD remains still a matter of debate. Alpha band alterations represent one of the most significant changes in the electrophysiological profile of AD. In particular, AD patients exhibit reduced alpha relative power and frequency. We used alpha band activity measured with MEG to study whether SCD and MCI elders present these electrophysiological changes characteristic of AD, and to determine the evolution of the observed alterations across AD spectrum. The total sample consisted of 131 participants: 39 elders without SCD, 41 elders with SCD and 51 MCI patients. All of them underwent MEG and MRI scans and neuropsychological assessment. SCD and MCI patients exhibited a similar reduction in alpha band activity compared with the no SCD group. However, only MCI patients showed a slowing in their alpha peak frequency compared with both SCD and no SCD. These changes in alpha band were related to worse cognition. Our results suggest that AD-related alterations may start in the SCD stage, with a reduction in alpha relative power. It is later, in the MCI stage, where the slowing of the spectral profile takes place, giving rise to objective deficits in cognitive functioning.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the power spectral changes between subjective cognitive decline (SCD) subjects and normal controls (NC) while checking the preclinical stage of AD in the SCD subjects and to use the derived data for biomarker research that can diagnose early-stage AD in the future.

Methods
We recruited 23 SCD patients and 23 normal control subjects and QEEG analysis including power spectral density (PSD) and source-level analysis were performed. An automated preprocessing procedure and statistical analysis were performed by iSync Brain® (iMediSync Inc., Republic of Korea) (https://isyncbrain.com/) using the international standard 10–20 system (19 electrodes).

Results
Absolute PSD, there was no statistically significant difference in all of the EEG power measurements of the 19 channels. In the relative PSD analysis, the average delta band power of the SCD group was significantly higher in Fp2, F4, and F8 than NC. Alpha1 band power of the O1 channel was 22.56±16.05 for the SCD group and 33.19±19.05 for the NC (p-value {\textless}0.05). Source-level analysis did not show a statistically significant difference.

Conclusion
SCD subjects showed a partial increase of delta waves in the frontal lobe region and a partial decrease in alpha1, a fast wave in the occipital region, compared to the NC. SCD is considered one of the earliest clinical symptoms of AD and it is predicted to be related to minor nerve damage. We were able to observe the power spectral changes in SCD subjects in this cross-sectional study, a large number of subjects and longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate their predictability for future deterioration such as conversion to MCI.},

Neurometric QEEG measures were found to be a sensitive index of degree of cognitive impairment, especially reflected in increased absolute and relative power in the theta band, with delta increasing in later stages of deterioration. While these abnormalities were widespread, neither localized or lateralized, MANOVA's for GDS and relative power in theta reached highest significance in a bilateral temporo-parietal arc. A possible relationship between hippocampal dysfunction, cognitive deterioration, and theta abnormalities is discussed in relation to these findings. The results suggest that Neurometric QEEG features are sensitive to the earliest presence of subjective cognitive dysfunction and might be useful in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected dementia, as well as in estimating the degree of cognitive deterioration in DAT patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There are relevant links between resting-state fMRI networks, EEG microstate classes and psychopathological alterations in mental disorders associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. We hypothesized that a certain microstate class, labeled C and correlated with the salience network, was impaired early in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and that microstate class D, correlated with the frontoparietal network, was impaired in schizophrenia.
METHODS: We measured resting EEG microstate parameters in patients with mild FTD (n = 18), schizophrenia (n = 20), mild Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 19) and age-matched controls (old n = 19, young n = 18) to investigate neuronal dynamics at the whole-brain level.
RESULTS: The duration of class C was significantly shorter in FTD than in controls and AD, and the duration of class D was significantly shorter in schizophrenia than in controls, FTD and AD. Transition analysis showed a reversed sequence of activation of classes C and D in FTD and schizophrenia patients compared with that in controls, with controls preferring transitions from C to D, and patients preferring D to C.
CONCLUSION: The duration and sequence of EEG microstates reflect specific aberrations of frontal lobe functions in FTD and schizophrenia.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the importance of subsecond brain dynamics for understanding of psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.},

	abstract = {The momentary, global functional state of the brain is reflected by its electric field configuration. Cluster analytical approaches consistently extracted four head-surface brain electric field configurations that optimally explain the variance of their changes across time in spontaneous EEG recordings. These four configurations are referred to as EEG microstate classes A, B, C, and D and have been associated with verbal/phonological, visual, subjective interoceptive–autonomic processing, and attention reorientation, respectively. The present study tested these associations via an intra-individual and inter-individual analysis approach. The intra-individual approach tested the effect of task-induced increased modality-specific processing on EEG microstate parameters. The inter-individual approach tested the effect of personal modality-specific parameters on EEG microstate parameters. We obtained multichannel EEG from 61 healthy, right-handed, male students during four eyes-closed conditions: object-visualization, spatial-visualization, verbalization (6 runs each), and resting (7 runs). After each run, we assessed participants' degrees of object-visual, spatial-visual, and verbal thinking using subjective reports. Before and after the recording, we assessed modality-specific cognitive abilities and styles using nine cognitive tests and two questionnaires. The EEG of all participants, conditions, and runs was clustered into four classes of EEG microstates (A, B, C, and D). RMANOVAs, ANOVAs and post-hoc paired t-tests compared microstate parameters between conditions. TANOVAs compared microstate class topographies between conditions. Differences were localized using eLORETA. Pearson correlations assessed interrelationships between personal modality-specific parameters and EEG microstate parameters during no-task resting. As hypothesized, verbal as opposed to visual conditions consistently affected the duration, occurrence, and coverage of microstate classes A and B. Contrary to associations suggested by previous reports, parameters were increased for class A during visualization, and class B during verbalization. In line with previous reports, microstate D parameters were increased during no-task resting compared to the three internal, goal-directed tasks. Topographic differences between conditions included particular sub-regions of components of the metabolic default mode network. Modality-specific personal parameters did not consistently correlate with microstate parameters except verbal cognitive style which correlated negatively with microstate class A duration and positively with class C occurrence. This is the first study that aimed to induce EEG microstate class parameter changes based on their hypothesized functional significance. Beyond the associations of microstate classes A and B with visual and verbal processing, respectively, our results suggest that a finely-tuned interplay between all four EEG microstate classes is necessary for the continuous formation of visual and verbal thoughts. Our results point to the possibility that the EEG microstate classes may represent the head-surface measured activity of intra-cortical sources primarily exhibiting inhibitory functions. However, additional studies are needed to verify and elaborate on this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The human brain contains an intricate network of about 100 billion neurons. Aging of the brain is characterized by a combination of synaptic pruning, loss of cortico-cortical connections, and neuronal apoptosis that provoke an age-dependent decline of cognitive functions. Neural/synaptic redundancy and plastic remodeling of brain networking, also secondary to mental and physical training, promote maintenance of brain activity and cognitive status in healthy elderly subjects for everyday life. However, age is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that impact on cognition. Growing evidence supports the idea that AD targets specific and functionally connected neuronal networks and that oscillatory electromagnetic brain activity might be a hallmark of the disease. In this line, digital electroencephalography (EEG) allows noninvasive analysis of cortical neuronal synchronization, as revealed by resting state brain rhythms. This review provides an overview of the studies on resting state eyes-closed EEG rhythms recorded in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects. Several studies support the idea that spectral markers of these EEG rhythms, such as power density, spectral coherence, and other quantitative features, differ among normal elderly, MCI, and AD subjects, at least at group level. Regarding the classification of these subjects at individual level, the most previous studies showed a moderate accuracy (70–80\%) in the classification of EEG markers relative to normal and AD subjects. In conclusion, resting state EEG makers are promising for large-scale, low-cost, fully noninvasive screening of elderly subjects at risk of AD.},

	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations have been shown to underlie various cognitive, perceptual and motor functions in the brain. However, studying these oscillations is notoriously difficult with EEG/MEG recordings due to a massive overlap of activity from multiple sources and also due to the strong background noise. Here we present a novel method for the reliable and fast extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel EEG/MEG/LFP recordings. The method is based on a linear decomposition of recordings: it maximizes the signal power at a peak frequency while simultaneously minimizing it at the neighboring, surrounding frequency bins. Such procedure leads to the optimization of signal-to-noise ratio and allows extraction of components with a characteristic “peaky” spectral profile, which is typical for oscillatory processes. We refer to this method as spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD). Our simulations demonstrate that the method allows extraction of oscillatory signals even with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 1:10. The SSD also outperformed conventional approaches based on independent component analysis. Using real EEG data we also show that SSD allows extraction of neuronal oscillations (e.g., in alpha frequency range) with high signal-to-noise ratio and with the spatial patterns corresponding to central and occipito-parietal sources. Importantly, running time for SSD is only a few milliseconds, which clearly distinguishes it from other extraction techniques usually requiring minutes or even hours of computational time. Due to the high accuracy and speed, we suggest that SSD can be used as a reliable method for the extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel electrophysiological recordings.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Studies using functional connectivity and network analyses based on magnetoencephalography (MEG) with source localization are rapidly emerging in neuroscientific literature. However, these analyses currently depend on the availability of costly and sometimes burdensome individual MR scans for co-registration. We evaluated the consistency of these measures when using a template MRI, instead of native MRI, for the analysis of functional connectivity and network topology.
METHODS: Seventeen healthy participants underwent resting-state eyes-closed MEG and anatomical MRI. These data were projected into source space using an atlas-based peak voxel and a centroid beamforming approach either using (1) participants' native MRIs or (2) the Montreal Neurological Institute's template. For both methods, time series were reconstructed from 78 cortical atlas regions. Relative power was determined in six classical frequency bands per region and globally averaged. Functional connectivity (phase lag index) between each pair of regions was calculated. The adjacency matrices were then used to reconstruct functional networks, of which regional and global metrics were determined. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated and Bland-Altman plots were made to quantify the consistency and potential bias of the use of template versus native MRI.
RESULTS: Co-registration with the template yielded largely consistent relative power, connectivity, and network estimates compared to native MRI.
DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that there is no (systematic) bias or inconsistency between template and native MRI co-registration of MEG. They open up possibilities for retrospective and prospective analyses to MEG datasets in the general population that have no native MRIs available.

We apply it to subdural recordings from humans performing a visual delayed match-to-sample task and systematically compare it with spectral amplitude and coherence. The different measures often show divergent results. In particular, AEC reveals γ-coupling completely missed by coherence. We argue that coherence and AEC are adapted to different cortical mechanisms of short- and long-range interactions, respectively.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease characterised primarily by motor system degeneration, with clinical evidence of cognitive and behavioural change in up to 50\% of cases. ALS is both clinically and biologically heterogeneous. Subgrouping is currently undertaken using clinical parameters, such as site of symptom onset (bulbar or spinal), burden of disease (based on the modified El Escorial Research Criteria) and genomics in those with familial disease. However, with the exception of genomics, these subcategories do not take into account underlying disease pathobiology, and are not fully predictive of disease course or prognosis.Recently, we have shown that resting-state EEG can reliably and quantitatively capture abnormal patterns of motor and cognitive network disruption in ALS. These network disruptions have been identified across multiple frequency bands, and using measures of neural activity (spectral power) and connectivity (co-modulation of activity by amplitude envelope correlation and synchrony by imaginary coherence) on source-localised brain oscillations from high-density EEG. Using data-driven methods (similarity network fusion and spectral clustering), we have now undertaken a clustering analysis to identify disease subphenotypes and to determine whether different patterns of disruption are predictive of disease outcome.We show that ALS patients (N = 95) can be subgrouped into four phenotypes with distinct neurophysiological profiles. These clusters are characterised by varying degrees of disruption in the somatomotor (α-band synchrony), frontotemporal (β-band neural activity and γl-band synchrony) and frontoparietal (γl-band co-modulation) networks, which reliably correlate with distinct clinical profiles and different disease trajectories. Using an in-depth stability analysis, we show that these clusters are statistically reproducible and robust, remain stable after re-assessment using a follow-up EEG session, and continue to predict the clinical trajectory and disease outcome.Our data demonstrate that novel phenotyping using neuroelectric signal analysis can distinguish disease subtypes based exclusively on different patterns of network disturbances. These patterns may reflect underlying disease neurobiology. The identification of ALS subtypes based on profiles of differential impairment in neuronal networks has clear potential in future stratification for clinical trials. Advanced network profiling in ALS can also underpin new therapeutic strategies that are based on principles of neurobiology and designed to modulate network disruption.},

The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

Although signals recorded in parallel by multiple, near-adjacent EEG scalp electrode channels are highly-correlated and combine signals from many different sources, biological and non-biological, independent component analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the various source generator processes underlying those recordings. Independent components (IC) found by ICA decomposition can be manually inspected, selected, and interpreted, but doing so requires both time and practice as ICs have no order or intrinsic interpretations and therefore require further study of their properties. Alternatively, sufficiently-accurate automated IC classifiers can be used to classify ICs into broad source categories, speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition in near-real-time applications. While many such classifiers have been proposed recently, this work presents the ICLabel project comprised of (1) the ICLabel dataset containing spatiotemporal measures for over 200,000 ICs from more than 6,000 EEG recordings and matching component labels for over 6,000 of those ICs, all using common average reference, (2) the ICLabel website for collecting crowdsourced IC labels and educating EEG researchers and practitioners about IC interpretation, and (3) the automated ICLabel classifier, freely available for MATLAB. The ICLabel classifier improves upon existing methods in two ways: by improving the accuracy of the computed label estimates and by enhancing its computational efficiency. The classifier outperforms or performs comparably to the previous best publicly available automated IC component classification method for all measured IC categories while computing those labels ten times faster than that classifier as shown by a systematic comparison against other publicly available EEG IC classifiers.},

It is now widely accepted that independent component analysis (ICA) may be a useful tool for isolating artifacts and/or cortical processes from electroencephalographic (EEG) data. We present results of simulations demonstrating that ICA decomposition, here tested using three popular ICA algorithms, Infomax, SOBI, and FastICA, can allow more sensitive automated detection of small non-brain artifacts than applying the same detection methods directly to the scalp channel data. We tested the upper bound performance of five methods for detecting various types of artifacts by separately optimizing and then applying them to artifact-free EEG data into which we had added simulated artifacts of several types, ranging in size from thirty times smaller (-50 dB) to the size of the EEG data themselves (0 dB). Of the methods tested, those involving spectral thresholding were most sensitive. Except for muscle artifact detection where we found no gain of using ICA, all methods proved more sensitive when applied to the ICA-decomposed data than applied to the raw scalp data: the mean performance for ICA was higher and situated at about two standard deviations away from the performance distribution obtained on raw data. We note that ICA decomposition also allows simple subtraction of artifacts accounted for by single independent components, and/or separate and direct examination of the decomposed non-artifact processes themselves.},

The software is implemented as a MATLAB toolbox and includes a complete set of consistent and user-friendly high-level functions that allow experimental neuroscientists to analyze experimental data. It includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis, such as time-frequency analysis using multitapers, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers, connectivity analysis, and nonparametric statistical permutation tests at the channel and source level. The implementation as toolbox allows the user to perform elaborate and structured analyses of large data sets using the MATLAB command line and batch scripting. Furthermore, users and developers can easily extend the functionality and implement new algorithms. The modular design facilitates the reuse in other software packages.},

	abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) and blind source separation (BSS) methods are increasingly used to separate individual brain and non-brain source signals mixed by volume conduction in electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological recordings. We compared results of decomposing thirteen 71-channel human scalp EEG datasets by 22 ICA and BSS algorithms, assessing the pairwise mutual information (PMI) in scalp channel pairs, the remaining PMI in component pairs, the overall mutual information reduction (MIR) effected by each decomposition, and decomposition ‘dipolarity’ defined as the number of component scalp maps matching the projection of a single equivalent dipole with less than a given residual variance. The least well-performing algorithm was principal component analysis (PCA); best performing were AMICA and other likelihood/mutual information based ICA methods. Though these and other commonly-used decomposition methods returned many similar components, across 18 ICA/BSS algorithms mean dipolarity varied linearly with both MIR and with PMI remaining between the resulting component time courses, a result compatible with an interpretation of many maximally independent EEG components as being volume-conducted projections of partially-synchronous local cortical field activity within single compact cortical domains. To encourage further method comparisons, the data and software used to prepare the results have been made available (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BSSComparison).},

	abstract = {Objective: We investigated the influence of symmetry assumptions implicit in the derivation and the use of event-related lateralized potentials (ERLs), such as the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). We describe these assumptions and demonstrate several alternative computational methods. Methods: Using analytical methods and forward simulations, we computed the error in the ERL topography that results from deviations in symmetry between homologous brain areas. Based on analytical considerations we show that, for source analysis, the ERL derivation provides no benefits compared to a single subtraction of the two (left-lateralized and right-lateralized) conditions underlying the ERL. Results: Relative errors of 10\% in the ERL topography are found if the location of an active region in one hemisphere differs by 10 mm from the symmetric location as compared to the other hemisphere A difference of 30° in orientation results in a relative error of the ERL of 40\%. Differences in source strength between hemispheres result in an ERL error that is half the size of the relative strength difference. Conclusions: We estimate that, due to violations of the symmetry assumption underlying the ERL, errors in the ERL topography of 10–40\% can be expected. Source analysis does not benefit from the ERL. In topographic mapping and source analysis, the double subtraction of the ERL should be approached with caution and the single subtraction of the ERPs of two lateralized conditions should be first analyzed whenever possible. We suggest that analyses based on the topography of the ERL should only be performed after the assumption of symmetry has been validated.},

However, despite the concept of microstates is straight-forward and offers various quantifications of the EEG signal with a relatively clear neurophysiological interpretation, a few important aspects about the currently applied methods are not readily comprehensible. Here we aim to increase the transparency about the methods to facilitate widespread application and reproducibility of EEG microstate analysis by introducing a new EEGlab toolbox for Matlab. EEGlab and the Microstate toolbox are open source, allowing the user to keep track of all details in every analysis step. The toolbox is specifically designed to facilitate the development of new methods. While the toolbox can be controlled with a graphical user interface (GUI), making it easier for newcomers to take their first steps in exploring the possibilities of microstate analysis, the Matlab framework allows advanced users to create scripts to automatise analysis for multiple subjects to avoid tediously repeating steps for every subject. This manuscript provides an overview of the most commonly applied microstate methods as well as a tutorial consisting of a comprehensive walk-through of the analysis of a small, publicly available dataset.},

Here, we present an approach which is insensitive to false connectivity arising from volume conduction. Methods: We show that the (complex) coherency of non-interacting sources is necessarily real and, hence, the imaginary part of coherency provides an excellent candidate to study brain interactions. Although the usual magnitude and phase of coherency contain the same information as the real and imaginary parts, we argue that the Cartesian representation is far superior for studying brain interactions. The method is demonstrated for EEG measurements of voluntary finger movement. Results: We found: (a) from 5 s before to movement onset a relatively weak interaction around 20 Hz between left and right motor areas where the contralateral side leads the ipsilateral side; and (b) approximately 2–4 s after movement, a stronger interaction also at 20 Hz in the opposite direction. Conclusions: It is possible to reliably detect brain interaction during movement from EEG data. Significance: The method allows unambiguous detection of brain interaction from rhythmic EEG/MEG data.},

The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the EEG/MEG neuroimaging problem: given measurements of scalp electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG: magnetoencephalogram), find the 3D distribution of the generating electric neuronal activity. This problem has no unique solution. Only particular solutions with "good" localization properties are of interest, since neuroimaging is concerned with the localization of brain function. In this paper, a general family of linear imaging methods with exact, zero error localization to point-test sources is presented. One particular member of this family is sLORETA (standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui, Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 2002, 24D:5-12; http://www.unizh.ch/keyinst/NewLORETA/sLORETA/sLORETA-Math01.pdf). It is shown here that sLORETA has no localization bias in the presence of measurement and biological noise. Another member of this family, denoted as eLORETA (exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui 2005: http://www.research-projects.unizh.ch/p6990.htm), is a genuine inverse solution (not merely a linear imaging method) with exact, zero error localization in the presence of measurement and structured biological noise. The general family of imaging methods is further extended to include data-dependent (adaptive) quasi-linear imaging methods, also with the exact, zero error localization property.},

	abstract = {Measures of linear dependence (coherence) and nonlinear dependence (phase synchronization) between any number of multivariate time series are defined. The measures are expressed as the sum of lagged dependence and instantaneous dependence. The measures are non-negative, and take the value zero only when there is independence of the pertinent type. These measures are defined in the frequency domain and are applicable to stationary and non-stationary time series. These new results extend and refine significantly those presented in a previous technical report (Pascual-Marqui 2007, arXiv:0706.1776 [stat.ME], http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1776), and have been largely motivated by the seminal paper on linear feedback by Geweke (1982 JASA 77:304-313). One important field of application is neurophysiology, where the time series consist of electric neuronal activity at several brain locations. Coherence and phase synchronization are interpreted as "connectivity" between locations. However, any measure of dependence is highly contaminated with an instantaneous, non-physiological contribution due to volume conduction and low spatial resolution. The new techniques remove this confounding factor considerably. Moreover, the measures of dependence can be applied to any number of brain areas jointly, i.e. distributed cortical networks, whose activity can be estimated with eLORETA (Pascual-Marqui 2007, arXiv:0710.3341 [math-ph]).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) refers to a diagnosis at the stage when patients come to the attention of clinicians because of concerns about changes in cognition, behavior, or functioning and can be still free of dementia and functionally independent.
OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively review existing scientific evidence on the benefits and potential challenges of making a timely diagnosis of AD.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching electronic databases (Medline, Embase) and bibliographies for studies published in English between 1 January 2000 and 2 June 2014 on the consequences of a timely diagnosis of AD.
RESULTS: Nine studies were identified that investigated the consequences of diagnosing AD at the initial stages; none were specifically focused on prodromal AD. A timely diagnosis potentially offers the opportunities of early intervention, implementation of coordinated care plans, better management of symptoms, patient safety, cost savings, and postponement of institutionalization. Barriers to making a timely diagnosis include stigma, suicide risk, lack of training, diagnostic uncertainty, shortage of specialized diagnostic services, and the reluctance of healthcare providers to make a diagnosis when no effective disease-modifying options are available.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its potential benefits, few published studies have explored the advantages or risks of a timely diagnosis of AD. In light of the cultural shift toward diagnosis at the initial stage of the disease continuum, when the patient does not yet have dementia, more investigations are needed to evaluate the benefits and address the barriers that may impede making a timely AD diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Revised diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) acknowledge a key role of imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy depends on which marker (i.e., amyloid imaging, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET, SPECT, MRI) as well as how it is measured (“metric”: visual, manual, semiautomated, or automated segmentation/computation). We evaluated diagnostic accuracy of marker vs metric in separating AD from healthy and prognostic accuracy to predict progression in mild cognitive impairment. The outcome measure was positive (negative) likelihood ratio, LR+ (LR−), defined as the ratio between the probability of positive (negative) test outcome in patients and the probability of positive (negative) test outcome in healthy controls. Diagnostic LR+ of markers was between 4.4 and 9.4 and LR− between 0.25 and 0.08, whereas prognostic LR+ and LR− were between 1.7 and 7.5, and 0.50 and 0.11, respectively. Within metrics, LRs varied up to 100-fold: LR+ from approximately 1 to 100; LR− from approximately 1.00 to 0.01. Markers accounted for 11\% and 18\% of diagnostic and prognostic variance of LR+ and 16\% and 24\% of LR−. Across all markers, metrics accounted for an equal or larger amount of variance than markers: 13\% and 62\% of diagnostic and prognostic variance of LR+, and 29\% and 18\% of LR−. Within markers, the largest proportion of diagnostic LR+ and LR− variability was within 18F-FDG-PET and MRI metrics, respectively. Diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of imaging AD biomarkers is at least as dependent on how the biomarker is measured as on the biomarker itself. Standard operating procedures are key to biomarker use in the clinical routine and drug trials.},

	abstract = {Objective
To capitalize on data from different clinical series to compare sensitivity and specificity of individual biomarkers for predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Methods
Medial temporal atrophy, cortical hypometabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were assessed in 18 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with prodromal AD (pAD; conversion time, 26 ± 12 months) and 18 stable MCI (sMCI) patients from the Translational Outpatient Memory Clinic cohort, as well as in 24 pAD patients (conversion time, 36 ± 12 months) and 33 sMCI patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Medial temporal atrophy was measured by manual, semi-automated, and automated hippocampal volumetry; cortical hypometabolism was measured using several indices of AD-related hypometabolism pattern; and cerebrospinal fluid markers were amyloid β (Aβ)42 and total tau protein concentrations. For each biomarker, sensitivity for pAD, specificity for sMCI, and diagnostic accuracy were computed.
Results
Sensitivity to predict MCI conversion to AD in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Translational Outpatient Memory Clinic cohorts was 79\% and 94\% based on Aβ42, 46\% and 28\% based on hippocampal volumes, 33\% to 66\% and 56\% to 78\% based on different hypometabolism indices, and 46\% and 61\% based on total tau levels, respectively. Specificity to exclude sMCI was 27\% and 50\% based on Aβ42, 76\% and 94\% based on hippocampal volumes, 58\% to 67\% and 55\% to 83\% based on different hypometabolism indices, and 61\% and 83\% based on total tau levels, respectively.
Conclusions
Current findings suggest that Aβ42 concentrations and hippocampal volumes may be used in combination to best identify pAD.},

In this review, the insight into the problem of Alzheimer Disease (AD) diagnostics will be given. The unquestionable
diagnosis is possible only during a post-mortem examination. AD is known as one of the forms of dementia and its differentiation from mild cognitive impairments has to be improved. Despite a great diagnostic progress during last decades, medicine still needs more accurate tools for an early
detection of this incurable disease. It is hoped that this strategy will enable an administration of more aggressive therapy preventing AD development. Nowadays, pharmacotherapy is based mainly on symptomatic treatment which is not able to reverse pathological changes caused by the disease.
Hence, more accurate identifying testing and monitoring methods are crucial to reveal new therapeutic targets. The most popular techniques present for detecting local brain functional changes use nuclear medicine imaging devices: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission
Computed Tomography (SPECT). Constant process of improving is not possible without new radiotracers. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a tool for an assessment of structural changes in brain tissue. However, providing satisfying results, these methods are not completely specific and accurate.
As very promising hallmarks of AD enhancing high accuracy of testing, biomarkers – tau tangles and β-amyloid plaques have been found. At the present time they are being used only as an additional examination, one day they may become a gold standard of AD diagnostics.},

Eyes-closed resting EEG was recorded in 79 Nold, 53 SMC, 51 non-amnesic MCI, and 92 amnesic MCI subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2–4Hz), theta (4–8Hz), alpha 1 (8–10.5Hz), alpha 2 (10.5–13Hz), beta 1 (13–20Hz), beta 2 (20–30Hz) and gamma (30–40Hz).

	abstract = {Subjective cognitive decline is a putative precursor to dementia marked by perceived worsening of cognitive function without overt performance issues on neuropsychological assessment. Although healthy older adults with subjective cognitive decline may function normally, perceived worsening may indicate incipient dementia and predict future deterioration. Therefore, the experience of decline represents a possible entry point for clinical intervention. However, intervention requires a physical manifestation of neuroabnormality to both corroborate incipient dementia and to target clinically. While some individuals with subjective cognitive decline may harbor pathophysiology for specific neurodegenerative disorders, many do not display clear indicators. Thus, disorder-agnostic brain measures could be useful to track the trajectory of decline, and functional neuroimaging in particular may be sensitive to detect incipient dementia and have the ability to track disease-related change when the underlying disease etiology remains unclear. Therefore, in this review, we discuss functional neuroimaging studies of subjective cognitive decline and possible reconciliations to inconsistent findings. We conclude by proposing a functional model where noisy signal propagation and inefficient signal processing across whole-brain networks may lead to the subjective experience of decline and discuss future research directions guided by this model.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) directly reflects brain electrical activity at the level of synapses. The aim of the present study was to investigate correlations of quantitative EEG measures, global field power (GFP) and global field synchronization (GFS), with conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration in patients diagnosed with subjective cognitive decline (n = 210), mild cognitive impairment (n = 230), and AD (n = 197). Decreased CSF amyloid β42 significantly correlated with increased theta and delta GFP, whereas increased p- and t-tau with decreased alpha and beta GFP. Decreased CSF amyloid β42 and increased p- and t-tau were significantly associated with decreased GFS alpha and beta. Subanalysis of the separate diagnostic groups demonstrated significant correlations between CSF biomarkers and generalized power and synchronization already in the subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment group. These results provide evidence that quantitative EEG measures are associated and possibly sensitive to distinct AD-like CSF biomarker profiles in cognitively impaired patients and are therefore promising early noninvasive markers of AD.},

Nevertheless, EEG currently has no established role in the clinical workup of individual patients. This opinion paper presents our critical view on why EEG has so far failed to keep its promise, and where we believe EEG will be clinically useful for patients threatened with cognitive decline in the future. Individual EEGs are an integral outcome of many causally intermixing upstream factors contributing to dementia. Therefore, EEG cannot become a clinically useful “simple” stand-alone biomarker of some pathognomic accumulations of specific brain proteins, but rather offer unique opportunities for more comprehensive and richly faceted insights into the functional status of brain systems. EEG may thus remain an essential window into the brain when it comes to the at-risk and presymptomatic phases of dementias, where it can be uniquely informative about concepts such as burdens of plasticity and repair, cognitive reserve, and sleep. Jointly with rapid gains in usability, portability, machine learning, closed loop systems, and understanding of the role of EEG-based sleep stages for memory and brain repair, EEG may come to keep its initial promise after all.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly with a progressive decline in cognitive function significantly affecting quality of life. Both the prevalence and emotional and financial burdens of AD on patients, their families, and society are predicted to grow significantly in the near future, due to a prolongation of the lifespan. Several lines of evidence suggest that modifications of risk-enhancing life styles and initiation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in the early stage of disease, although not able to modify its course, helps to maintain personal autonomy in daily activities and significantly reduces the total costs of disease management. Moreover, many clinical trials with potentially disease-modifying drugs are devoted to prodromal stages of AD. Thus, the identification of markers of conversion from prodromal form to clinically AD may be crucial for developing strategies of early interventions. The current available markers, including volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis are expensive, poorly available in community health facilities, and relatively invasive. Taking into account its low cost, widespread availability and non-invasiveness, electroencephalography (EEG) would represent a candidate for tracking the prodromal phases of cognitive decline in routine clinical settings eventually in combination with other markers. In this scenario, the present paper provides an overview of epidemiology, genetic risk factors, neuropsychological, fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in AD and describes the potential role of EEG in AD investigation, trying in particular to point out whether advanced analysis of EEG rhythms exploring brain function has sufficient specificity/sensitivity/accuracy for the early diagnosis of AD.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the utility of resting-state EEG measures as potential biomarkers for the detection and assessment of cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurophysiological biomarkers of AD derived from EEG and FDG-PET, once characterized and validated, would expand the set of existing diagnostic molecular biomarkers of AD pathology with associated biomarkers of disease progression and neural dysfunction. Since symptoms of AD often begin to appear later in life, successful identification of EEG-based biomarkers must account for age-related neurophysiological changes that occur even in healthy individuals. To this end, we collected EEG data from individuals with AD (n = 26), MCI (n = 53), and cognitively normal healthy controls stratified by age into three groups: 18-40 (n = 129), 40-60 (n = 62) and 60-90 (= 55) years old. For each participant, we computed power spectral density at each channel and spectral coherence between pairs of channels. Compared to age matched controls, in the AD group, we found increases in both spectral power and coherence at the slower frequencies (Delta, Theta). A smaller but significant increase in power of slow frequencies was observed for the MCI group, localized to temporal areas. These effects on slow frequency spectral power opposed that of normal aging observed by a decrease in the power of slow frequencies in our control groups. The AD group showed a significant decrease in the spectral power and coherence in the Alpha band consistent with the same effect in normal aging. However, the MCI group did not show any significant change in the Alpha band. Overall, Theta to Alpha ratio (TAR) provided the largest and most significant differences between the AD group and controls. However, differences in the MCI group remained small and localized. We proposed a novel method to quantify these small differences between Theta and Alpha bands' power using empirically derived distributions of spectral power across the time domain as opposed to averaging power across time. We defined Power Distribution Distance Measure (PDDM) as a distance measure between probability distribution functions (pdf) of Theta and Alpha power. Compared to average TAR, using PDDF enhanced the statistical significance, the effect size, and the spatial distribution of significant effects in the MCI group. We designed classifiers for differentiating individual MCI and AD participants from age-matched controls. The classification performance measured by the area under ROC curve after cross-validation were AUC = 0.85 and AUC = 0.6, for AD and MCI classifiers, respectively. Posterior probability of AD, TAR, and the proposed PDDM measure were all significantly correlated with MMSE score and neuropsychological tests in the AD group.},

	abstract = {Current biomarkers used in research and in clinical practice in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are the analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to detect levels of Aβ42 and phosphorylated-tau, amyloid and FDG-PET, and MRI volumetry. Some of these procedures are still invasive for patients or expensive. Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) are two non-invasive techniques able to detect the early synaptic dysfunction and track the course of the disease. However, in spite of its added value they are not part of the standard of care in clinical practice in dementia. In this paper we review what these neurophysiological techniques can add to the early diagnosis of AD, whether results in both modalities are related to each other or not, as well as the need of its validation against current biomarkers. We discuss their potential implications for the better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease as well as the need of performing simultaneous M/EEG recordings to better understand discrepancies between these two techniques. Finally, more studies are needed studying M/EEG with amyloid and Tau biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative processes of various types of dementia start years before symptoms, but the presence of a \&ldquo;neural reserve\&rdquo;, which continuously feeds and supports neuroplastic mechanisms, helps the aging brain to preserve most of its functions within the \&ldquo;normality\&rdquo; frame. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between dementia and normal brain aging. About 50\% of MCI subjects are already in a stage that is prodromal-to-dementia and during the following 3 to 5 years will develop clinically evident symptoms, while the other 50\% remains at MCI or returns to normal. If the risk factors favoring degenerative mechanisms are modified during early stages (i.e., in the prodromal), the degenerative process and the loss of abilities in daily living activities will be delayed. It is therefore extremely important to have biomarkers able to identify\&mdash;in association with neuropsychological tests\&mdash;prodromal-to-dementia MCI subjects as early as possible. MCI is a large (i.e., several million in EU) and substantially healthy population; therefore, biomarkers should be financially affordable, largely available and non-invasive, but still accurate in their diagnostic prediction. Neurodegeneration initially affects synaptic transmission and brain connectivity; methods exploring them would represent a 1st line screening. Neurophysiological techniques able to evaluate mechanisms of synaptic function and brain connectivity are attracting general interest and are described here. Results are quite encouraging and suggest that by the application of artificial intelligence (i.e., learning-machine), neurophysiological techniques represent valid biomarkers for screening campaigns of the MCI population.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition intermediate between physiological brain aging and dementia. Amnesic-MCI (aMCI) subjects progress to dementia (typically to Alzheimer-Dementia = AD) at an annual rate which is 20 times higher than that of cognitively intact elderly. The present study aims to investigate whether EEG network Small World properties (SW) combined with Apo-E genotyping, could reliably discriminate aMCI subjects who will convert to AD after approximately a year.
METHODS: 145 aMCI subjects were divided into two sub-groups and, according to the clinical follow-up, were classified as Converted to AD (C-MCI, 71) or Stable (S-MCI, 74).
RESULTS: Results showed significant differences in SW in delta, alpha1, alpha2, beta2, gamma bands, with C-MCI in the baseline similar to AD. Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve, based on a first-order polynomial regression of SW, showed 57\% sensitivity, 66\% specificity and 61\% accuracy(area under the curve: AUC=0.64). In 97 out of 145 MCI, Apo-E allele testing was also available. Combining this genetic risk factor with Small Word EEG, results showed: 96.7\% sensitivity, 86\% specificity and 91.7\% accuracy(AUC=0.97). Moreover, using only the Small World values in these 97 subjects, the ROC showed an AUC of 0.63; the resulting classifier presented 50\% sensitivity, 69\% specificity and 59.6\% accuracy. When different types of EEG analysis (power density spectrum) were tested, the accuracy levels were lower (68.86\%).
INTERPRETATION: Concluding, this innovative EEG analysis, in combination with a genetic test (both low-cost and widely available), could evaluate on an individual basis with great precision the risk of MCI progression. This evaluation could then be used to screen large populations and quickly identify aMCI in a prodromal stage of dementia. Ann Neurol 2018 Ann Neurol 2018;84:302-314.},

Twenty healthy controls (HC) underwent EEG recordings at the same time interval as the patients.Mutual information (MI) analysis measured the strength of functional network connectivity.FTD and AD patients showed greater MI at the prodromal stage of dementia (FTD vs. HC P = 2 × 10−8; AD vs. HC P = 4 × 10–3). Local connectivity was higher in left and right frontal areas of FTD (P = 7 × 10−5 and 0.03) and in left and right posterior areas in AD (P = 3 × 10−5 and 5 × 10−5) versus HC.We showed cortical hyperconnectivity at the prodromal stage of dementia in areas involved in the specific pathological process of FTD (frontal regions) and AD (posterior regions).

	abstract = {The application of the concept and methods of brain oscillations has been an important research area in neurosciences. In the last decades, besides the application in cognitive processes, the study of changes in brain oscillations in diseases has also become an important focal point of research. In the present paper, some remarkable examples in three different diseases are taken into consideration: 1) schizophrenia (SZ), 2) Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3) bipolar disorders (BD). In the current literature, decreased oscillations in cortical recordings are observed in most of the pathologies. For example, decrease of gamma activity in SZ, decrease of delta activity in almost all diseases, as well as frequency shifts in alpha and the lower frequencies were recorded. However, there are also paradoxical cases in which an increase of oscillatory activities is observed. In BD, whereas alpha activity is greatly decreased, a huge increase of beta activity is observed. Or, in SZ, a paradoxical increase of gamma activity can be observed during cognitive loading. We also observed paradoxical changes in the analysis of connectivity. In AD, we find that alpha, delta, and theta coherences between distant parts of the cortex are greatly decreased, whereas in the gamma band, event-related coherences attain very high values. The comparison of the results and paradoxical changes in diseases may lead to important conclusions related to the web of oscillations and neurotransmitters. In turn, we could gain new insights to approach “brain function”, in general.},

	abstract = {Multichannel recordings are commonly presented as topographic maps series displaying the change of the potential distribution over time. When reviewing a sequence of potential maps it becomes obvious that there are epochs with only little activity (few field lines; small extrema values) while at other times the fields display high peaks and deep troughs with steep gradients. The measure of global field power (GFP) corresponds to the spatial standard deviation, and it quantifies the amount of activity at each time point in the field considering the data from all recording electrodes simultaneously resulting in a reference-independent descriptor of the potential field. Global field power is plotted as a function of time, and the occurrence times of GFP maxima are used to determine the latencies of evoked potential components. The topographical change occurring in subsequent potential field distributions may also be quantified by computing an index of global dissimilarity. Global field power and global dissimilarity show a complementary behavior over time: in general, high GFP is associated with similar fields while during periods between GFP peaks the topographic patterns of successive field distributions change rapidly accompanied by high dissimilarity values. The topographic changes, however, are best recognized by a segmentation procedure that considers field structure independent of GFP and global dissimilarity. The principles and practical applications of GFP computation, component latency determination and global dissimilarity of potential field distributions as well as a topographical time segmentation procedure will be illustrated with multichannel data evoked by visual stimuli.},

In these and other ways these topographic analysis methods allow the experimenter to glean additional information and neurophysiologic interpretability beyond what is available from canonical waveform analyses. In this tutorial we present the example of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to stimulation of each hand to illustrate these points. For each step of these analyses, we provide the reader with both a conceptual and mathematical description of how the analysis is carried out, what it yields, and how to interpret its statistical outcome. We show that these topographic analysis methods are intuitive and easy-to-use approaches that can remove much of the guesswork often confronting ERP researchers and also assist in identifying the information contained within high-density ERP datasets.},

	abstract = {BackgroundSubjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) were considered to be a continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) spectrum. The abnormal topological architecture and rich-club organization in the brain functional network can reveal the pathology of the AD spectrum. However, few studies have explored the disrupted patterns of diverse club organizations and the combination of rich- and diverse-club organizations in SCD and aMCI.MethodsWe collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 19 SCDs, 29 aMCIs, and 28 healthy controls (HCs) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Graph theory analysis was used to analyze the network metrics and rich- and diverse-club organizations simultaneously.ResultsCompared with HC, the aMCI group showed altered small-world and network efficiency, whereas the SCD group remained relatively stable. The aMCI group showed reduced rich-club connectivity compared with the HC. In addition, the aMCI group showed significantly increased feeder connectivity and decreased local connectivity of the diverse club compared with the SCD group. The overlapping nodes of the rich club and diverse club showed a significant difference in nodal efficiency and shortest path length (Lp) between groups. Notably, the Lp values of overlapping nodes in the SCD and aMCI groups were significantly associated with episodic memory.ConclusionThe present study demonstrates that the network properties of SCD and aMCI have varying degrees of damage. The combination of the rich club and the diverse club can provide a novel insight into the pathological mechanism of the AD spectrum. The altered patterns in overlapping nodes might be potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of the AD spectrum.},

Here, we tested the hypothesis of additional abnormalities in functional cortical connectivity computed in those sources, in ADD, considered as a "disconnection cortical syndrome", in comparison with PDD and DLB. Resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms had been collected in 42 ADD, 42 PDD, 34 DLB, and 40 normal healthy older (Nold) participants. Exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) freeware estimated the functional lagged linear connectivity (LLC) from rsEEG cortical sources in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve indexed the classification accuracy between Nold and diseased individuals (only values {\textgreater}0.7 were considered). Interhemispheric and intrahemispheric LLCs in widespread delta sources were abnormally higher in the ADD group and, unexpectedly, normal in DLB and PDD groups. Intrahemispheric LLC was reduced in widespread alpha sources dramatically in ADD, markedly in DLB, and moderately in PDD group. Furthermore, the interhemispheric LLC in widespread alpha sources showed lower values in ADD and DLB than PDD groups. At the individual level, AUROC curves of LLC in alpha sources exhibited better classification accuracies for the discrimination of ADD versus Nold individuals (0.84) than for DLB versus Nold participants (0.78) and PDD versus Nold participants (0.75). Functional cortical connectivity markers in delta and alpha sources suggest a more compromised neurophysiological reserve in ADD than DLB, at both group and individual levels.},

	abstract = {As the EEG inverse problem does not have a unique solution, the sources reconstructed from EEG and their connectivity properties depend on forward and inverse modeling parameters such as the choice of an anatomical template and electrical model, prior assumptions on the sources, and further implementational details. In order to use source connectivity analysis as a reliable research tool, there is a need for stability across a wider range of standard estimation routines. Using resting state EEG recordings of N=65 participants acquired within two studies, we present the first comprehensive assessment of the consistency of EEG source localization and functional/effective connectivity metrics across two anatomical templates (ICBM152 and Colin27), three electrical models (BEM, FEM and spherical harmonics expansions), three inverse methods (WMNE, eLORETA and LCMV), and three software implementations (Brainstorm, Fieldtrip and our own toolbox). Source localizations were found to be more stable across reconstruction pipelines than subsequent estimations of functional connectivity, while effective connectivity estimates where the least consistent. All results were relatively unaffected by the choice of the electrical head model, while the choice of the inverse method and source imaging package induced a considerable variability. In particular, a relatively strong difference was found between LCMV beamformer solutions on one hand and eLORETA/WMNE distributed inverse solutions on the other hand. We also observed a gradual decrease of consistency when results are compared between studies, within individual participants, and between individual participants. In order to provide reliable findings in the face of the observed variability, additional simulations involving interacting brain sources are required. Meanwhile, we encourage verification of the obtained results using more than one source imaging procedure.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers have become an essential component of Alzheimer disease (AD) research and because of the pervasiveness of AD pathology in the elderly, the same biomarkers are used in cognitive aging research. A number of current issues suggest that an unbiased descriptive classification scheme for these biomarkers would be useful. We propose the “A/T/N” system in which 7 major AD biomarkers are divided into 3 binary categories based on the nature of the pathophysiology that each measures. “A” refers to the value of a β-amyloid biomarker (amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42); “T,” the value of a tau biomarker (CSF phospho tau, or tau PET); and “N,” biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury ([18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET, structural MRI, or CSF total tau). Each biomarker category is rated as positive or negative. An individual score might appear as A+/T+/N−, or A+/T−/N−, etc. The A/T/N system includes the new modality tau PET. It is agnostic to the temporal ordering of mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. It includes all individuals in any population regardless of the mix of biomarker findings and therefore is suited to population studies of cognitive aging. It does not specify disease labels and thus is not a diagnostic classification system. It is a descriptive system for categorizing multidomain biomarker findings at the individual person level in a format that is easy to understand and use. Given the present lack of consensus among AD specialists on terminology across the clinically normal to dementia spectrum, a biomarker classification scheme will have broadest acceptance if it is independent from any one clinically defined diagnostic scheme.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

	abstract = {In supervised learning scenarios, feature selection has been studied widely in the literature. Selecting features in unsupervised learning scenarios is a much harder problem, due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. And, almost all of previous unsupervised feature selection methods are "wrapper" techniques that require a learning algorithm to evaluate the candidate feature subsets. In this paper, we propose a "filter" method for feature selection which is independent of any learning algorithm. Our method can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised fashion. The proposed method is based on the observation that, in many real world classification problems, data from the same class are often close to each other. The importance of a feature is evaluated by its power of locality preserving, or, Laplacian Score. We compare our method with data variance (unsupervised) and Fisher score (supervised) on two data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {Network dysfunction is well established in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been shown to be present early in the disease. This is especially interesting in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) since they are more likely to develop AD. In EEG, one type of network analysis is microstates where the EEG is divided into quasi-stable states and these microstates have been linked to networks found with resting state functional MRI. In the current exploratory study, we therefore wanted to explore the changes in microstates in MCI, and AD compared to healthy controls (HC) and whether microstates were able to separate patients with MCI who progressed (pMCI) and those who remained stable (sMCI). EEGs were recorded at baseline for 17 patients with AD, 27 patients with MCI, and 38 older HC and the patients were followed for 3 years. To investigate whole-brain dynamics we extracted different microstate parameters. We found that patients with MCI, and AD had significantly higher occurrence (p-value = 0.028), and coverage (p-value = 0.010) for microstate A compared to HC. However, we did not find any significant systematic deviation of the transition probabilities from randomness for any of the groups. No significant differences were found between pMCI and sMCI but the largest difference in duration was found for microstate D. Microstate A has been linked to the temporal lobes in studies combining EEG and fMRI and the temporal lobes are the most affected by AD pathology in the early stages of the disease. This supports our idea that microstate A may be the first affected microstate in early AD. Even though not significant between pMCI and sMCI, Microstate D has previously been shown to be associated with both frontal and parietal areas as measured with fMRI and may correspond to underlying pathological changes in the progression of MCI to AD. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {This systematic review examined whether event-related potentials (ERPs) during higher cognitive processing can detect subtle, early signs of neurodegenerative disease. Original, empirical studies retrieved from PsycINFO and PubMed were reviewed if they analyzed patterns in cognitive ERPs (≥150 ms post-stimulus) differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), or cognitively intact elders who carry AD risk through the Apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele (ε4+) from healthy older adult controls (HC). The 100 studies meeting inclusion criteria (MCI = 47; AD = 47; ε4+ = 6) analyzed N200, P300, N400, and occasionally, later components. While there was variability across studies, patterns of reduced amplitude and delayed latency were apparent in pathological aging, consistent with AD-related brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. These effects were particularly evident in advanced disease progression (i.e., AD {\textgreater} MCI) and in later ERP components measured during complex tasks. Although ERP studies in intact ε4+ elders are thus far scarce, a similar pattern of delayed latency was notable, along with a contrasting pattern of increased amplitude, consistent with compensatory neural activation. This limited work suggests ERPs might be able to index early neural changes indicative of future cognitive decline in otherwise healthy elders. As ERPs are also accessible and affordable relative to other neuroimaging methods, their addition to cognitive assessment might substantively enhance early identification and characterization of neural dysfunction, allowing opportunity for earlier differential diagnosis and targeting of intervention. To evaluate this possibility there is urgent need for well-powered studies assessing late cognitive ERPs during complex tasks, particularly in healthy elders at risk for cognitive decline.},

Methods We included 1,167 cognitively unimpaired participants, aged 70 to 95 years, from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging based on 2 concurrent SCD scales (part of the Blessed memory test and the 39-item Everyday Cognition [ECog] scale, which included a validated 12-item derivative) and a single question assessing worry about cognitive decline. We evaluated multiple ways to dichotomize scores. In continuous models, we compared average scores on 4 ECog domains and multidomain (39- and 12-item) ECog scores. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between each measure and risk of MCI in models adjusted for objective memory performance, depression, anxiety, sex, APOE ε4 carriership, and medical comorbidities.
Results It was possible to select a substantial group of participants (14\%) at increased risk of incident MCI based on combined baseline endorsement of any consistent SCD on the ECog (any item scored ≥3; 12-item ECog hazard ratio [HR] 2.17 [95\% confidence interval 1.51–3.13]) and worry (HR 1.79 [1.24–2.58]) in an adjusted model combining these dimensions. In continuous models, all ECog domains and the multidomain scores were associated with risk of MCI with a small advantage for multidomain SCD (12-item ECog HR 2.13 [1.36–3.35] per point increase in average score). Information provided by the informant performed comparable to self-perceived SCD.

The objective of the study is to validate attention and memory tasks that elicit event-related potentials (ERPs) for utility as sensitive biomarkers for early dementia.
Methods
A 3-choice vigilance task designed to evaluate sustained attention and standard image recognition memory task designed to evaluate attention, encoding, and image recognition memory were administered with concurrent electroencephalography acquisition to elicit ERPs in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy cohorts. ERPs were averaged, and mean or maximum amplitude of components was measured and compared between and within cohorts.
Results
There was significant suppression of the amplitude of the late positive potential in the MCI cohort compared with the healthy controls during 3-choice vigilance task, predominantly over occipital and right temporal-parietal region, and standard image recognition memory task over all regions. During standard image recognition memory task, diminished performance showed strong correlation with electroencephalography measurements. The old/new effects observed in the healthy controls cohort correlated with performance and were lost in MCI.
Discussion
ERPs obtained during cognitive tasks may provide a powerful tool for assessing MCI and have strong potential as sensitive and robust biomarkers for tracking disease progression and evaluating response to investigative therapeutics.},

Those alterations have been also described in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD. There is a growing interest in detecting AD pathology in the brain in the very early stages of the disorder. Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) could represent a preclinical asymptomatic stage of AD but very little is known about this population. In the present work we assessed whether FC disruptions are already present in this stage, and if they share any spatial distribution properties with MCI alterations (a condition known to be highly related to AD). To this end, we measured electromagnetic spontaneous activity with MEG in 39 healthy control elders, 41 elders with SCD and 51 MCI patients. The results showed FC alterations in both SCD and MCI compared to the healthy control group. Interestingly, both groups exhibited a very similar spatial pattern of altered links: a hyper-synchronized anterior network and a posterior network characterized by a decrease in FC. This decrease was more pronounced in the MCI group. These results highlight that elders with SCD present FC alterations. More importantly, those disruptions affected AD typically related areas and showed great overlap with the alterations exhibited by MCI patients. These results support the consideration of SCD as a preclinical stage of AD and may indicate that FC alterations appear very early in the course of the disease.},

We performed a systematic literature review on Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) in order to examine whether the resemblance of brain connectome and functional connectivity (FC) alterations in SCD with respect to MCI, AD and HC can help us draw conclusions on the progression of SCD to more advanced stages of dementia.
Methods
We searched for studies that used any neuroimaging tool to investigate potential differences/similarities of brain connectome in SCD with respect to HC, MCI, and AD.
Results
Sixteen studies were finally included in the review. Apparent FC connections and disruptions were observed in the white matter, default mode and gray matter networks in SCD with regards to HC, MCI, and AD. Interestingly, more apparent connections in SCD were located over the posterior regions, while an increase of FC over anterior regions was observed as the disease progressed.
Conclusions
Elders with SCD display a significant disruption of the brain network, which in most of the cases is worse than HC across multiple network parameters.
Significance
The present review provides comprehensive and balanced coverage of a timely target research activity around SCD with the intention to identify similarities/differences across patient groups on the basis of brain connectome properties.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is a largely unknown state thought to represent a preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) previous to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the course of network disruption in these stages is scarcely characterized. Methods: We employed resting state magnetoencephalography in the source space to calculate network smallworldness, clustering, modularity and transitivity. Nodal measures (clustering and node degree) as well as modular partitions were compared between groups. Results: The MCI group exhibited decreased smallworldness, clustering and transitivity and increased modularity in theta and beta bands. SCD showed similar but smaller changes in clustering and transitivity, while exhibiting alterations in the alpha band in opposite direction to those showed by MCI for modularity and transitivity. At the node level, MCI disrupted both clustering and nodal degree while SCD showed minor changes in the latter. Additionally, we observed an increase in modular partition variability in both SCD and MCI in theta and beta bands. Conclusion: SCD elders exhibit a significant network disruption, showing intermediate values between HC and MCI groups in multiple parameters. These results highlight the relevance of cognitive concerns in the clinical setting and suggest that network disorganization in AD could start in the preclinical stages before the onset of cognitive symptoms.},

All underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluations, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography.Berkeley Aging Cohort Study.Relationship between PiB uptake and subjective cognition measures.Subjects with high PiB uptake showed significantly lower performance than those with low PiB uptake on an episodic memory measure and were less confident about their general memory abilities when required to evaluate themselves relative to other people of the same age. High and low PiB uptake groups did not differ on the accuracy of their cognitive self-reports compared with objective cognitive performance. General memory self-reports from the whole group were significantly correlated with regional PiB uptake in the right medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Reduced confidence about memory abilities was associated with greater PiB uptake in these brain regions. All results were independent of demographic variables and depressive affects.A decrease of self-confidence about memory abilities in cognitively normal elderly subjects may be related to the neuropathological hallmark of AD measured with PiB–positron emission tomography. Subjective cognitive impairment may represent a very early clinical manifestation of AD.},

                        Method
                        In a community cohort study of 1336 people without dementia, 4-year
                           changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging measures were investigated as
                           correlates of subjective memory impairment at baseline and follow-up.
                     
                     
                        Results
                        Subjective memory impairment at baseline was associated with subsequent
                           change in hippocampal volume and at follow-up impairment was associated
                           with previous change in hippocampal, cerebrospinal fluid and grey matter
                           volume and with subcortical white matter lesion increases. All
                           associations with volume changes were U-shaped with significant quadratic

                           impairment were potentially explained by lower baseline hippocampal
                           volumes in the groups with least volume change. Associations between
                           hippocampal volume change and subjective memory impairment at follow-up
                           were independent of cognitive decline and depressive symptoms, they were
                           stronger in participants with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ∊4 allele and

The past decade has witnessed tremendous growth in research on SCD, which may reflect the recognition of SCD as the earliest symptomatic manifestation of AD. Yet methodological challenges associated with establishing common assessment and classification procedures hamper the construct. This article reviews essential features of SCD associated with preclinical AD and current measurement approaches, highlighting challenges in harmonizing study findings across settings. We consider the relation of SCD to important variables and outcomes (e.g., AD biomarkers, clinical progression). We also examine the role of self- and informant-reports in SCD and various psychological, medical, and demographic factors that influence the self-report of cognition. We conclude with a discussion of intervention strategies for SCD, ethical considerations, and future research priorities.},

	abstract = {Objectives This review provides a broad overview of the effectiveness of interventions for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in improving psychological well-being, metacognition and objective cognitive performance.
Methods Databases including PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Systematic Reviews were searched up to August 2017 to identify randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for SCD. Interventions were categorised as psychological, cognitive, lifestyle or pharmacological. Outcomes of interest included psychological well-being, metacognitive ability and objective cognitive performance. To assess the risk of bias, three authors independently rated study validity using criteria based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Random-effects meta-analyses were undertaken where three or more studies investigated similar interventions and reported comparable outcomes.
Results Twenty studies met inclusion criteria and 16 had sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analyses. Of these, only seven were rated as being high quality. Group psychological interventions significantly improved psychological well-being (g=0.40, 95\% CI 0.03 to 0.76; p=0.03) but the improvement they conferred on metacognitive ability was not statistically significant (g=0.26, 95\% CI −0.22 to 0.73; p=0.28). Overall, cognitive training interventions led to a small, statistically significant improvement in objective cognitive performance (g=0.13, 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.25; p=0.03). However, the pooled effect sizes of studies using active control groups (g=0.02, 95\% CI −0.19 to 0.22; p=0.85) or reporting global cognitive measures (g=0.06, 95\% CI –0.19 to 0.31; p=0.66) were non-significant.
Conclusions There is a lack of high-quality research in this field. Group psychological interventions improve psychological well-being and may also improve metacognition. A large, high-quality study is indicated to investigate this further. There is no evidence to suggest that cognitive interventions improve global cognitive performance and the clinical utility of small improvements in specific cognitive domains is questionable. There is a lack of research considering lifestyle interventions and poor quality evidence for pharmacological interventions.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible correlation between "Small World" characteristics of the brain connectivity architecture-as extracted from EEG recordings-and hippocampal volume in AD patients. A dataset of 144 subjects, including 110 AD (MMSE 21.3) and 34 healthy Nold (MMSE 29.8) individuals, was evaluated. Weighted and undirected networks were built by the eLORETA solutions of the cortical sources' activities moving from EEG recordings. The evaluation of the hippocampal volume was carried out on a subgroup of 60 AD patients who received a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence and underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the Freesurfer image analysis software. Results showed that, quantitatively, more correlation was observed in the right hemisphere, but the same trend was seen in both hemispheres. Alpha band connectivity was negatively correlated, while slow (delta) and fast-frequency (beta, gamma) bands positively correlated with hippocampal volume. Namely, the larger the hippocampal volume, the lower the alpha and the higher the delta, beta, and gamma Small World characteristics of connectivity. Accordingly, the Small World connectivity pattern could represent a functional counterpart of structural hippocampal atrophying and related-network disconnection.},

Specifically, we conciliate quantitative studies of microcircuitry and the functional logic of neuronal computations. We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference—paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

	abstract = {Jupyter Notebooks have been widely adopted by many different communities, both in science and industry. They support the creation of literate programming documents that combine code, text, and execution results with visualizations and other rich media. The self-documenting aspects and the ability to reproduce results have been touted as significant benefits of notebooks. At the same time, there has been growing criticism that the way in which notebooks are being used leads to unexpected behavior, encourages poor coding practices, and makes it hard to reproduce its results. To better understand good and bad practices used in the development of real notebooks, in prior work we studied 1.4 million notebooks from GitHub. We presented a detailed analysis of their characteristics that impact reproducibility, proposed best practices that can improve the reproducibility, and discussed open challenges that require further research and development. In this paper, we extended the analysis in four different ways to validate the hypothesis uncovered in our original study. First, we separated a group of popular notebooks to check whether notebooks that get more attention have more quality and reproducibility capabilities. Second, we sampled notebooks from the full dataset for an in-depth qualitative analysis of what constitutes the dataset and which features they have. Third, we conducted a more detailed analysis by isolating library dependencies and testing different execution orders. We report how these factors impact the reproducibility rates. Finally, we mined association rules from the notebooks. We discuss patterns we discovered, which provide additional insights into notebook reproducibility. Based on our findings and best practices we proposed, we designed Julynter, a Jupyter Lab extension that identifies potential issues in notebooks and suggests modifications that improve their reproducibility. We evaluate Julynter with a remote user experiment with the goal of assessing Julynter recommendations and usability.},

	abstract = {Goal: We present and evaluate a wearable high-density dry-electrode EEG system and an open-source software framework for online neuroimaging and state classification. Methods: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine subjects using the dry EEG system. Results: Simulations yielded high accuracy (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time directdirected transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.09) and LCMV (0.72 ± 0.08) source localization. Cortical ERPbased classification was equivalent to ProxConn for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.16) butsignificantlybetterforLCMV (0.82 ± 0.12). Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and cognitive state classification from highdensity wearable dry EEG. Significance: This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and brain-computer interfaces. The pipelines are made freely available in the open-source SIFT and BCILAB toolboxes.},

However, the effectiveness of ASR and the optimal choice of its parameter have not been systematically evaluated and reported, especially on actual EEG data. Methods: This paper systematically evaluates ASR on 20 EEG recordings taken during simulated driving experiments. Independent component analysis (ICA) and an independent component classifier are applied to separate artifacts from brain signals to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the ASR. Results: ASR removes more eye and muscle components than brain components. Even though some eye and muscle components retain after ASR cleaning, the power of their temporal activities is reduced. Study results also showed that ASR cleaning improved the quality of a subsequent ICA decomposition. Conclusions: Empirical results show that the optimal ASR parameter is between 20 and 30, balancing between removing non-brain signals and retaining brain activities. Significance: With an appropriate choice of parameter, ASR can be a powerful and automatic artifact removal approach for offline data analysis or online real-time EEG applications such as clinical monitoring and brain-computer interfaces.},

Predation is hypothesized as one selective pressure that may have driven the evolution of multicellularity. Here we show that de novo origins of simple multicellularity can evolve in response to predation. We subjected outcrossed populations of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to selection by the filter-feeding predator Paramecium tetraurelia. Two of five experimental populations evolved multicellular structures not observed in unselected control populations within {\textasciitilde}750 asexual generations. Considerable variation exists in the evolved multicellular life cycles, with both cell number and propagule size varying among isolates. Survival assays show that evolved multicellular traits provide effective protection against predation. These results support the hypothesis that selection imposed by predators may have played a role in some origins of multicellularity.},

	abstract = {In 2018, there was a recent shift towards a biological definition of Alzheimer's disease (AD), based on biomarkers measured in vivo even before the onset of clinical dementia symptoms. No single biomarker can by itself accurately diagnose AD. A combination of biomarkers assessed through imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) yields better diagnostic accuracy. Although amyloid PET imaging and CSF levels of amyloid and tau deposits are increasingly used in AD clinical trials to increase diagnostic confidence in enrolled subjects, routine use of these biomarkers in clinical settings is still premature because of the risk of overdiagnosis, increased cost and/or invasiveness of the assessment method. Also, standardization of measures across studies is needed to assure biomarker regulatory approval. Exploring novel biomarkers beyond the amyloid and tau pathologies, and their longitudinal change across the AD continnum are important research avenues for the future.},

	abstract = {The effect of an active reference in EEG recording is one of the oldest technical problems in EEG practice. In this paper, a method is proposed to approximately standardize the reference of scalp EEG recordings to a point at infinity. This method is based on the fact that the use of scalp potentials to determine the neural electrical activities or their equivalent sources does not depend on the reference, so we may approximately reconstruct the equivalent sources from scalp EEG recordings with a scalp point or average reference. Then the potentials referenced at infinity are approximately reconstructed from the equivalent sources. As a point at infinity is far from all the possible neural sources, this method may be considered as a reference electrode standardization technique (REST). The simulation studies performed with assumed neural sources included effects of electrode number, volume conductor model and noise on the performance of REST, and the significance of REST in EEG temporal analysis. The results showed that REST is potentially very effective for the most important superficial cortical region and the standardization could be especially important in recovering the temporal information of EEG recordings.},

With this proof-of-concept phase in the past, the time is now ripe to focus on the development of practical BCI technologies that can be brought out of the lab and into real-world applications. In particular, we focus on the prospect of improving the lives of countless disabled individuals through a combination of BCI technology with existing assistive technologies (AT). In pursuit of more practical BCIs for use outside of the lab, in this paper, we identify four application areas where disabled individuals could greatly benefit from advancements in BCI technology, namely, “Communication and Control”, “Motor Substitution”, “Entertainment”, and “Motor Recovery”. We review the current state of the art and possible future developments, while discussing the main research issues in these four areas. In particular, we expect the most progress in the development of technologies such as hybrid BCI architectures, user–machine adaptation algorithms, the exploitation of users’ mental states for BCI reliability and confidence measures, the incorporation of principles in human–computer interaction (HCI) to improve BCI usability, and the development of novel BCI technology including better EEG devices.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity (FC) is among the most informative features derived from EEG. However, the most straightforward sensor-space analysis of FC is unreliable owing to volume conductance effects. An alternative—source-space analysis of FC—is optimal for high- and mid-density EEG (hdEEG, mdEEG); however, it is questionable for widely used low-density EEG (ldEEG) because of inadequate surface sampling. Here, using simulations, we investigate the performance of the two source FC methods, the inverse-based source FC (ISFC) and the cortical partial coherence (CPC). To examine the effects of localization errors of the inverse method on the FC estimation, we simulated an oscillatory source with varying locations and SNRs. To compare the FC estimations by the two methods, we simulated two synchronized sources with varying between-source distance and SNR. The simulations were implemented for hdEEG, mdEEG, and ldEEG. We showed that the performance of both methods deteriorates for deep sources owing to their inaccurate localization and smoothing. The accuracy of both methods improves with the increasing between-source distance. The best ISFC performance was achieved using hd/mdEEG, while the best CPC performance was observed with ldEEG. In conclusion, with hdEEG, ISFC outperforms CPC and therefore should be the preferred method. In the studies based on ldEEG, the CPC is a method of choice.},

AR model parameters are scale-invariant features that can be used to develop models of artifacts across a population. We use a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate among artifact conditions using the AR model parameters as features.

A perfect-reconstruction filterbank is used to split the data into two parts, one noise-free and the other contaminated by line artifact. The artifact-contaminated stream is processed by a spatial filter to project out line components, and added to the noise-free part to obtain clean data. This method is applicable to multichannel data such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or multichannel local field potentials (LFP).

	abstract = {Most studies of continuous EEG data have used frequency transformation, which allows the quantification of brain states that vary over seconds. For the analysis of shorter, transient EEG events, it is possible to identify and quantify brain electric microstates as subsecond time epochs with stable field topography. These microstates may correspond to basic building blocks of human information processing. Microstate analysis yields a compact and comprehensive repertoire of short lasting classes of brain topographic maps, which may be considered to reflect global functional states. Each microstate class is described by topography, mean duration, frequency of occurrence and percentage analysis time occupied. This paper presents normative microstate data for resting EEG obtained from a database of 496 subjects between the age of 6 and 80 years. The extracted microstate variables showed a lawful, complex evolution with age. The pattern of changes with age is compatible with the existence of developmental stages as claimed by developmental psychologists. The results are discussed in the framework of state dependent information processing and suggest the existence of biologically predetermined top-down processes that bias brain electric activity to functional states appropriate for age-specific learning and behavior.},

European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 249, 205-211] suggested that shortening concerned specific microstate classes. Sequence rules (microstate concatenations, syntax) conceivably might also be affected. In 27 patients of the above type and 27 controls, from three centers, multichannel resting EEG was analyzed into microstates using k-means clustering of momentary potential topographies into four microstate classes (A-D). In patients, microstates were shortened in classes B and D (from 80 to 70 ms and from 94 to 82 ms, respectively), occurred more frequently in classes A and C, and covered more time in A and less in B. Topography differed only in class B where LORETA tomography predominantly showed stronger left and anterior activity in patients. Microstate concatenation (syntax) generally were disturbed in patients; specifically, the class sequence A--{\textgreater}C--{\textgreater}D--{\textgreater}A predominated in controls, but was reversed in patients (A--{\textgreater}D--{\textgreater}C--{\textgreater}A). In schizophrenia, information processing in certain classes of mental operations might deviate because of precocious termination. The intermittent occurrence might account for Bleuler's "double bookkeeping." The disturbed microstate syntax opens a novel physiological comparison of mental operations between patients and controls.},

	abstract = {New treatments for Alzheimer's disease require early detection of cognitive decline. Most studies seeking to identify markers of early cognitive decline have focused on a limited number of measures. We sought to establish the profile of brain function measures which best define early neuropsychological decline. We compared subjects with subjective memory complaints to normative controls on a wide range of EEG derived measures, including a new measure of event-related spatio-temporal waves and biophysical modeling, which derives anatomical and physiological parameters based on subject's EEG measurements. Measures that distinguished the groups were then related to cognitive performance on a variety of learning and executive function tasks. The EEG measures include standard power measures, peak alpha frequency, EEG desynchronization to eyes-opening, and global phase synchrony. The most prominent differences in subjective memory complaint subjects were elevated alpha power and an increased number of spatio-temporal wave events. Higher alpha power and changes in wave activity related most strongly to a decline in verbal memory performance in subjects with subjective memory complaints, and also declines in maze performance and working memory reaction time. Interestingly, higher alpha power and wave activity were correlated with improved performance in reverse digit span in the subjective memory complaint group. The modeling results suggest that differences in the subjective memory complaint subjects were due to a decrease in cortical and thalamic inhibitory gains and slowed dendritic time-constants. The complementary profile that emerges from the variety of measures and analyses points to a nonlinear progression in electrophysiological changes from early neuropsychological decline to late-stage dementia, and electrophysiological changes in subjective memory complaint that vary in their relationships to a range of memory-related tasks.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Numerous outcomes from hundreds of patients collectively indicate that (sub-)acute QEEG indices from standard systems can uniquely inform clinical management, particularly prognostication of outcomes from IS. Two classes of QEEG indices have proven particularly informative. The first quantifies the power of abnormal, slow activity relative to that of faster activity and the second, interhemispheric voltage asymmetry (broadband). Both have been identified as statistically significant predictors of outcomes assessed (via routine clinical scales) in the weeks and months following IS. Furthermore both have demonstrated higher predictive value than concomitant neurological assessments and scales, and to improve upon outcome prediction afforded by neuroimaging alone. These indices also may continuously provide unique, real-time insights into the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy, prior to clinical changes. Two key applications of QEEG which should prove valuable for future clinical management of IS are: (1) continuous, acute monitoring to inform about the efficacy of thrombolysis and decisions about potential additional interventions, and; (2) brief, subacute recording to inform outcome prognostication and clinical decisions about, for example, rehabilitation strategies. Ongoing research and technological developments will continue to facilitate clinical translation of QEEG investigations reviewed herein.},

	abstract = {Accurate predictions of motor impairment after stroke are of cardinal importance for the patient, clinician, and healthcare system. More than 10 years ago, the proportional recovery rule was introduced by promising that high-fidelity predictions of recovery following stroke were based only on the initially lost motor function, at least for a specific fraction of patients. However, emerging evidence suggests that this recovery rule is subject to various confounds and may apply less universally than previously assumed. Here, we systematically revisited stroke outcome predictions by applying strategies to avoid confounds and fitting hierarchical Bayesian models. We jointly analysed 385 post-stroke trajectories from six separate studies—one of the largest overall datasets of upper limb motor recovery. We addressed confounding ceiling effects by introducing a subset approach and ensured correct model estimation through synthetic data simulations. Subsequently, we used model comparisons to assess the underlying nature of recovery within our empirical recovery data. The first model comparison, relying on the conventional fraction of patients called ‘fitters’, pointed to a combination of proportional to lost function and constant recovery. ‘Proportional to lost’ here describes the original notion of proportionality, indicating greater recovery in case of a more severe initial impairment. This combination explained only 32\% of the variance in recovery, which is in stark contrast to previous reports of \&gt;80\%. When instead analysing the complete spectrum of subjects, ‘fitters’ and ‘non-fitters’, a combination of proportional to spared function and constant recovery was favoured, implying a more significant improvement in case of more preserved function. Explained variance was at 53\%. Therefore, our quantitative findings suggest that motor recovery post-stroke may exhibit some characteristics of proportionality. However, the variance explained was substantially reduced compared to what has previously been reported. This finding motivates future research moving beyond solely behaviour scores to explain stroke recovery and establish robust and discriminating single-subject predictions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Specialized electroencephalography (EEG) methods have been used to provide clues about stroke features and prognosis. However, the value of routine EEG in stroke patients without (suspected) seizures has been somewhat neglected. We aimed to assess this in a group of acute ischemic stroke patients in regard to short-term prognosis and basic stroke features. Methods: We assessed routine (10–20) EEG findings in 69 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients without seizures. Associations between EEG abnormalities and NIHSS scores, clinical improvement or deterioration as well as MRI stroke characteristics were evaluated. Results: Mean age was 69 ± 18 years, 43 of the patients (62.3\%) were men. Abnormal EEG was found in 40 patients (58\%) and was associated with higher age (p = 0.021). The most common EEG pathology was focal slowing (30; 43.5\%). No epileptiform potentials were found. Abnormal EEG in general and generalized or focal slowing in particular was significantly associated with higher NIHSS score on admission and discharge as well as with hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic lesion. Abnormal EEG and generalized (but not focal) slowing were associated with clinical deterioration ( p = 0.036, p = 0.003). Patients with lacunar strokes had no EEG abnormalities. Conclusions: Abnormal EEG in general and generalized slowing in particular are associated with clinical deterioration after acute ischemic stroke. The study demonstrates the value of routine EEG as a simple diagnostic tool in the evaluation of stroke patients especially with regard to short-term prognosis.},

	abstract = {Objective
To identify the most accurate quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) predictor(s) of unfavorable post-ischemic stroke outcome, and its discriminative capacity compared to already known demographic, clinical and imaging prognostic markers.
Methods
Prospective cohort of 151 consecutive anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients followed for 12 months. EEG was recorded within 72 h and at discharge or 7 days post-stroke. QEEG (global band power, symmetry, affected/unaffected hemisphere and time changes) indices were calculated from mean Fast Fourier Transform and analyzed as predictors of unfavorable outcome (mRS ≥ 3), at discharge and 12 months poststroke, before and after adjustment for age, admission NIHSS and ASPECTS.
Results
Higher delta, lower alpha and beta relative powers (RP) predicted outcome. Indices with higher discriminative capacity were delta-theta to alpha-beta ratio (DTABR) and alpha RP. Outcome models including either of these and other clinical/imaging stroke outcome predictors were superior to models without qEEG data. In models with qEEG indices, infarct size was not a significant outcome predictor.
Conclusions
DTAABR and alpha RP are the best qEEG indices and superior to ASPECTS in post-stroke outcome prediction. They improve the discriminative capacity of already known clinical and imaging stroke outcome predictors, both at discharge and 12 months after stroke.
Significance
qEEG indices are independent predictors of stroke outcome.},

	abstract = {Stroke is the commonest cause of disability. Novel treatments require an improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of recovery. Fractal approaches have demonstrated that a single metric can describe the complexity of seemingly random fluctuations of physiological signals. We hypothesize that fractal algorithms applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals may track brain impairment after stroke. Sixteen stroke survivors were studied in the hyperacute ({\textless}48 h) and in the acute phase (∼1 week after stroke), and 35 stroke survivors during the early subacute phase (from 8 days to 32 days and after ∼2 months after stroke): We compared resting-state EEG fractal changes using fractal measures (i.e., Higuchi Index, Tortuosity) with 11 healthy controls. Both Higuchi index and Tortuosity values were significantly lower after a stroke throughout the acute and early subacute stage compared to healthy subjects, reflecting a brain activity which is significantly less complex. These indices may be promising metrics to track behavioral changes in the very early stage after stroke. Our findings might contribute to the neurorehabilitation quest in identifying reliable biomarkers for a better tailoring of rehabilitation pathways.},

(doi:10.1093/brain/awv200).The global impact of stroke remains high and improving long-term outcomes for stroke survivors is a crucially important clinical and scientific goal. Dramatic improvements will only come about through understanding the mechanisms of recovery and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Functional brain imaging studies of recovering human stroke survivors have been used for a number of years in an attempt to uncover these mechanisms. In general, such studies show that recovery of both movement and language after stroke is supported by functionally relevant reorganization within task-relevant brain networks. However, the exact pattern of reorganization, and therefore the exact role played by each brain region, appears to depend on factors such as the configuration of the residual structural architecture. While these studies have established that post-stroke brain network reorganization is functionally relevant, it is difficult as yet to see how they have influenced clinical practice (Ward, 2015). The questions that concern most clinicians are how to predict outcome, identify suitable patients for specific treatments, and develop new therapeutic approaches. In this issue of Brain, Nicolo et al. (2015) attempt the first of these by using electroencephalography (EEG) to identify regional and modality specific alterations in early post-stroke brain function that account for differences in subsequent clinical improvement over the next 3 months.},

	abstract = {See Ward (doi:10.1093/brain/awv265) for a scientific commentary on this article.Recent findings have demonstrated that stroke lesions affect neural communication in the entire brain. However, it is less clear whether network interactions are also relevant for plasticity and repair. This study investigated whether the coherence of neural oscillations at language or motor nodes is associated with future clinical improvement. Twenty-four stroke patients underwent high-density EEG recordings and standardized motor and language tests at 2–3 weeks (T0) and 3 months (T1) after stroke onset. In addition, EEG and motor assessments were obtained from a second population of 18 stroke patients. The graph theoretical measure of weighted node degree at language and motor areas was computed as the sum of absolute imaginary coherence with all other brain regions and compared to the amount of clinical improvement from T0 to T1. At T0, beta-band weighted node degree at the ipsilesional motor cortex was linearly correlated with better subsequent motor improvement, while beta-band weighted node degree at Broca’s area was correlated with better language improvement. Clinical recovery was further associated with contralesional theta-band weighted node degree. These correlations were each specific to the corresponding brain area and independent of initial clinical severity, age, and lesion size. Findings were reproduced in the second stroke group. Conversely, later coherence increases occurring between T0 and T1 were associated with less clinical improvement. Improvement of language and motor functions after stroke is therefore associated with inter-regional synchronization of neural oscillations in the first weeks after stroke. A better understanding of network mechanisms of plasticity may lead to new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

Objective. We aimed to investigate (1) the time course of cortical activation as revealed by EEG-based spectral characteristics during awake rest and (2) the development of these spectral characteristics in relation to global neurological and upper-limb motor recovery in the first 6 months poststroke. Methods. Resting-state EEG was measured serially in 41 patients after a first-ever ischemic stroke, within 3 and at 5, 12, and 26 weeks poststroke. We computed the brain symmetry index (BSI) and directional BSI (BSIdir) over different frequency bands (1-25 Hz, delta, theta) and delta/alpha ratio (DAR). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of the upper extremity (FM-UE) were determined as clinical reflections of spontaneous neurobiological recovery. Longitudinal changes in spectral characteristics and within- and between-subject associations with NIHSS and FM-UE were analyzed with linear mixed models. Results. Spectral characteristics showed a gradual normalization over time, within and beyond 12 weeks poststroke. Significant within- and between-subject associations with NIHSS were found for DAR of the affected hemisphere (DARAH) and BSIdirdelta. BSIdirdelta also demonstrated significant within- and between-subject associations with FM-UE. Conclusions. Changes in spectral characteristics are not restricted to the time window of recovery of clinical neurological impairments. The present study suggests that decreasing DARAH and BSIdirdelta reflect improvement of global neurological impairments, whereas BSIdirdelta was also specifically associated with upper-limb motor recovery early poststroke.},

However, stroke lesions can also induce modifications in the functional connectivity of intrinsic brain networks, which could be responsible for the behavioral impairment. Though resting state networks (RSNs) are typically mapped using fMRI, it has been recently shown that they can also be detected from high-density EEG. We build on a state-of-the-art approach to extract RSNs from 64-channels EEG activity in a group of right stroke patients and to identify neural predictors of their cognitive performance. Fourteen RSNs previously found in fMRI and high-density EEG studies on healthy participants were successfully reconstructed from our patients' EEG recordings. We then correlated EEG-RSNs functional connectivity with neuropsychological scores, first considering a wide frequency band (1–80 Hz) and then specific frequency ranges in order to examine the association between each EEG rhythm and the behavioral impairment. We found that visuo-spatial and motor impairments were primarily associated with the dorsal attention network, with contribution dependent on the specific EEG band. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that there is a core system of brain networks involved in specific cognitive domains. Moreover, our results pave the way for low-cost EEG-based monitoring of intrinsic brain networks’ functioning in neurological patients to complement clinical-behavioral measures.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been utilized to describe and monitor brain function following neuro-trauma, and technological advances have improved usability in the acute setting. However, skepticism persists whether EEG can provide the same prognostic value as neurological examination.Objective: The current cohort study examined the relationship between acute single-channel EEG and functional outcomes after stroke.Methods: Resting-state EEG recorded at a single left pre-frontal EEG channel (FP1) was obtained from 16 adults within 72 h of first stroke. At 30 and 90 days, measures of disability (modified Rankin Scale; mRS) and involvement in daily activities (modified Barthel Index; mBI) were obtained. Acute EEG measures were correlated with functional outcomes and compared to an early neurological examination of stroke severity using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Classification of good outcomes (mRS ≤1 or mBI ≥95) was also examined using Receiver Operator Curve analyses.Results: One-third to one-half of participants experienced incomplete post-stroke recovery, depending on the time point and measure. Functional outcomes correlated with acute theta values (rs 0.45–0.60), with the strength of associations equivalent to previously reported values obtained from conventional multi-channel systems. Acute theta values ≥0.25 were associated with good outcomes, with positive (67-83\%) and negative predictive values (70-90\%) comparable to those obtained using the NIHSS.Conclusions: Acute, single-channel EEG can provide unique, non-overlapping clinical information, which may facilitate objective prediction of functional outcome after stroke.},

	abstract = {Objective
The aim was to find a sensitive method to highlight the remodeling of the brain’s bioelectric activity in post-stroke repair.
Methods
Fifteen mild upper limb paretic stroke patients and age-matched healthy controls were included. Repeated trials of finger tapping around the 10th and 100th days after stroke onset were recorded with a 128-channel EEG. Power spectra and Inter Trial Coherence (ITC) calculations were synchronized to tappings. ITC was correlated with motor performance.
Results
ITC, in low frequency bands, designates the motor related bioelectric activity in channel space in both healthy subjects and patients. Ten days after stroke onset, delta-theta ITC was severely reduced compared to baseline, while three months later ITC reorganized partially over the ipsilesional central-parietal areas reflecting the improvement of motor networks. Decreased ITC in the central-parietal area remained significant compared to controls. Delta band ITC over the dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex correlates with the performance on Nine Hole Peg Test. At post-recovery, non-paretic hand tappings show significantly decreased delta-theta ITC over the supplementary motor area, which reflects network remodeling.
Conclusions
Inter Trial Coherence is a useful measure of brain reorganization during stroke recovery.
Significance
Delta- theta ITC is a sensitive indicator of impaired motor execution.},

	abstract = {Individual alpha frequency (IAF) is a promising electrophysiological marker of interindividual differences in cognitive function. IAF has been linked with trait-like differences in information processing and general intelligence, and provides an empirical basis for the definition of individualized frequency bands. Despite its widespread application, however, there is little consensus on the optimal method for estimating IAF, and many common approaches are prone to bias and inconsistency. Here, we describe an automated strategy for deriving two of the most prevalent IAF estimators in the literature: peak alpha frequency (PAF) and center of gravity (CoG). These indices are calculated from resting-state power spectra that have been smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (SGF). We evaluate the performance characteristics of this analysis procedure in both empirical and simulated EEG data sets. Applying the SGF technique to resting-state data from n = 63 healthy adults furnished 61 PAF and 62 CoG estimates. The statistical properties of these estimates were consistent with previous reports. Simulation analyses revealed that the SGF routine was able to reliably extract target alpha components, even under relatively noisy spectral conditions. The routine consistently outperformed a simpler method of automated peak detection that did not involve spectral smoothing. The SGF technique is fast, open source, and available in two popular programming languages (MATLAB, Python), and thus can easily be integrated within the most popular M/EEG toolsets (EEGLAB, FieldTrip, MNE-Python). As such, it affords a convenient tool for improving the reliability and replicability of future IAF-related research.},

	abstract = {GOAL: We present and evaluate a wearable high-density dry-electrode EEG system and an open-source software framework for online neuroimaging and state classification.
METHODS: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine subjects using the dry EEG system.
RESULTS: Simulations yielded high accuracy (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time direct-directed transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 ±0.09) and LCMV (0.72 ±0.08) source localization. Cortical ERP-based classification was equivalent to ProxConn for cLORETA (0.74 ±0.16) but significantly better for LCMV (0.82 ±0.12) .
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and cognitive state classification from high-density wearable dry EEG.
SIGNIFICANCE: This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and brain-computer interfaces. The pipelines are made freely available in the open-source SIFT and BCILAB toolboxes.},

	abstract = {High variability between individual subjects and recording sessions is a known fact about scalp recorded EEG signal. While some do, the majority of the EEG based machine learning studies do not attempt to assess performance of algorithms across recording sessions or across subjects, instead studies use the whole data-set available for training and testing, using an established k-fold cross validation technique and thus missing performance in a real-life setting on an unseen subject. This study primarily aimed to show how important is to have a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) evaluation done for any scalp recorded EEG based machine learning. This study also demonstrates effectiveness of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in getting good LOSO accuracy from balanced, clean EEG data, without any pre-processing in comparison with traditional machine learning algorithms. The study used data from participants diagnosed with schizophrenia, as well as a group of participants with no known neurological disorder. Classification was done using traditional methods and MLP to classify the participants as belonging to disease or control subjects. Results shows that 85\% accuracy on unseen subject was achievable from a clean data-set. MLP is seen to be effective in finding features by which schizophrenia could be detected from clean EEG data. LOSO evaluation done with this proven MLP configuration using carefully and intentionally corrupted data clearly indicate that for disease diagnosis, the k-fold classification result is misleading. Therefore, evaluation of any scalp recorded EEG based disease classification method must use a LOSO style cross-validation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the most accurate quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) predictor(s) of unfavorable post-ischemic stroke outcome, and its discriminative capacity compared to already known demographic, clinical and imaging prognostic markers.
METHODS: Prospective cohort of 151 consecutive anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients followed for 12 months. EEG was recorded within 72 h and at discharge or 7 days post-stroke. QEEG (global band power, symmetry, affected/unaffected hemisphere and time changes) indices were calculated from mean Fast Fourier Transform and analyzed as predictors of unfavorable outcome (mRS ≥ 3), at discharge and 12 months poststroke, before and after adjustment for age, admission NIHSS and ASPECTS.
RESULTS: Higher delta, lower alpha and beta relative powers (RP) predicted outcome. Indices with higher discriminative capacity were delta-theta to alpha-beta ratio (DTABR) and alpha RP. Outcome models including either of these and other clinical/imaging stroke outcome predictors were superior to models without qEEG data. In models with qEEG indices, infarct size was not a significant outcome predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: DTAABR and alpha RP are the best qEEG indices and superior to ASPECTS in post-stroke outcome prediction. They improve the discriminative capacity of already known clinical and imaging stroke outcome predictors, both at discharge and 12 months after stroke.
SIGNIFICANCE: qEEG indices are independent predictors of stroke outcome.},

	abstract = {In 2008, it was proposed that the magnitude of recovery from nonsevere upper limb motor impairment over the first 3 to 6 months after stroke, measured with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), is approximately 0.7 times the initial impairment (“proportional recovery”). In contrast to patients with nonsevere hemiparesis, about 30\% of patients with an initial severe paresis do not show such recovery (“nonrecoverers”). Hence it was suggested that the proportional recovery rule (PRR) was a manifestation of a spontaneous mechanism that is present in all patients with mild-to-moderate paresis but only in some with severe paresis. Since the introduction of the PRR, it has subsequently been applied to other motor and nonmotor impairments. This more general investigation of the PRR has led to inconsistencies in its formulation and application, making it difficult to draw conclusions across studies and precipitating some cogent criticism. Here, we conduct a detailed comparison of the different studies reporting proportional recovery and, where appropriate, critique statistical methodology. On balance, we conclude that existing data in aggregate are largely consistent with the PRR as a population-level model for upper limb motor recovery; recent reports of its demise are exaggerated, as these excessively focus on the less conclusive issue of individual subject-level predictions. Moving forward, we suggest that methodological caution and new analytical approaches will be needed to confirm (or refute) a systematic character to spontaneous recovery from motor and other poststroke impairments, which can be captured by a mathematical rule either at the population or at the subject level.},

	abstract = {A brain injury resulting from unilateral stroke critically alters brain functionality and the complex balance within the cortical activity. Such modifications may critically depend on lesion location and cortical involvement. Indeed, recent findings pointed out the necessity of applying a stratification based on lesion location when investigating inter-hemispheric balance in stroke. Here, we tested whether cortical involvement could imply differences in band-specific activity and brain symmetry in post stroke patients with cortico-subcortical and subcortical strokes. We explored brain activity related to lesion location through EEG power analysis and quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG) measures. Thirty stroke patients in the subacute phase and 10 neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Stroke patients were equally subdivided in two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, mean age ± SD: 72.21 ± 10.97 years; time since stroke ± SD: 31.14 ± 11.73 days) and subcortical (S, mean age ± SD: 68.92 ± 10.001 years; time since stroke ± SD: 26.93 ± 13.08 days) group. We assessed patients’ neurological status by means of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). High density EEG at rest was recorded and power spectral analysis in Delta (1–4 Hz) and Alpha (8–14 Hz) bands was performed. qEEG metrics as pairwise derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI) and Delta/Alpha Ratio (DAR) were computed and correlated with NIHSS score. S showed a lower Delta power in the Unaffected Hemisphere (UH) compared to Affected Hemisphere (AH; z = −1.98, p {\textless} 0.05) and a higher Alpha power compared to CS (z = −2.18, p {\textless} 0.05). pdBSI was negatively correlated with NIHSS (R = −0.59, p {\textless} 0.05). CS showed a higher value and symmetrical distribution of Delta band activity (z = −2.37, p {\textless} 0.05), confirmed also by a higher DAR value compared to S (z = −2.48, p {\textless} 0.05). Patients with cortico-subcortical and subcortical lesions show different brain symmetry in the subacute phase. Interestingly, in subcortical stroke patient brain activity is related with the clinical function. qEEG measures can be explicative of brain activity related to lesion location and they could allow precise definition of diagnostic-therapeutic algorithms in stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Early and objective prediction of functional outcome after stroke is an important issue in rehabilitation. Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been utilized to describe and monitor brain function following neuro-trauma, and technological advances have improved usability in the acute setting. However, skepticism persists whether EEG can provide the same prognostic value as neurological examination.Objective: The current cohort study examined the relationship between acute single-channel EEG and functional outcomes after stroke.Methods: Resting-state EEG recorded at a single left pre-frontal EEG channel (FP1) was obtained from 16 adults within 72 h of first stroke. At 30 and 90 days, measures of disability (modified Rankin Scale; mRS) and involvement in daily activities (modified Barthel Index; mBI) were obtained. Acute EEG measures were correlated with functional outcomes and compared to an early neurological examination of stroke severity using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Classification of good outcomes (mRS ≤1 or mBI ≥95) was also examined using Receiver Operator Curve analyses.Results: One-third to one-half of participants experienced incomplete post-stroke recovery, depending on the time point and measure. Functional outcomes correlated with acute theta values (rs 0.45–0.60), with the strength of associations equivalent to previously reported values obtained from conventional multi-channel systems. Acute theta values ≥0.25 were associated with good outcomes, with positive (67-83\%) and negative predictive values (70-90\%) comparable to those obtained using the NIHSS.Conclusions: Acute, single-channel EEG can provide unique, non-overlapping clinical information, which may facilitate objective prediction of functional outcome after stroke.},

The advances in the medical management of stroke patients over the past decade have significantly reduced mortality, but at the same time increased numbers of disabled survivors. Unfortunately, this reduction in mortality was not paralleled by satisfactory therapeutics and rehabilitation strategies that can improve functional recovery of patients. Motor recovery after brain injury is a complex, dynamic, and multifactorial process in which an interplay among genetic, pathophysiologic, sociodemographic and therapeutic factors determines the overall recovery trajectory. Although stroke recovery is the most well-studied form of post-injury neuronal recovery, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology and determinants affecting stroke recovery is still lacking. Understanding the different variables affecting brain recovery after stroke will not only provide an opportunity to develop therapeutic interventions but also allow for developing personalized platforms for patient stratification and prognosis. We aim to provide a narrative review of major determinants for post-stroke recovery and their implications in other forms of brain injury.},

	abstract = {Reductions in blood flow to the brain of sufficient duration and extent lead to stroke, which results in damage to neuronal networks and impairment of sensation, movement or cognition.A time-limited window of neuroplasticity opens following stroke in the adult brain, during which partial behavioural recovery can occur. Neuroplasticity can be further augmented by rehabilitative therapy.Enhanced sensory and motor performance that occur after stroke is referred to as recovery, although re-emergent post-stroke behaviour is unlikely to be identical to the pre-stroke state. A more accurate definition of recovery is behavioural compensation provided by remaining and newly developed brain circuits that results in altered and/or new response strategies.Plasticity in the adult brain after stroke is enabled by a surprising amount of diffuse and redundant connectivity in the CNS and the ability of new structural and functional circuits to form through remapping between related cortical regions.Many of the molecular mechanisms that underlie stroke recovery are identical to those involved in development. A 'critical period' of heightened neuroplasticity that is akin to that occurring during visual system development might exist after stroke. For successful rehabilitation after stroke it is crucial to align behavioural interventions with critical periods.It is possible to conceptualize synaptic learning rules after stroke into two broad classes and temporal phases: first, homeostatic mechanisms ensure that each neuron receives an adequate amount of synaptic input akin to homeostatic plasticity; second, Hebbian mechanisms occur, during which synaptic strength is redistributed to favour coincident activity and properly functioning circuits.},

	abstract = {Functional limitation of the upper extremities is common in patients with stroke. An upper-extremity measure with sound psychometric properties is indispensable for clinical and research use.The purpose of this study was to compare the psychometric properties of 4 clinical measures for assessing upper-extremity motor function in people with stroke: the upper-extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Test (UE-FM), the upper-extremity subscale of the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and the Wolf Motor Function Test.This was a prospective, longitudinal study.Fifty-three people with stroke were evaluated with the 4 measures at 4 time points (14, 30, 90, and 180 days after stroke). Thirty-five participants completed all of the assessments. The ceiling and floor effects, validity (concurrent validity and predictive validity), and responsiveness of each measure were examined. Interrater reliability and test-retest reliability also were examined.All measures, except for the UE-FM, had significant floor effects or ceiling effects at one or more time points. The Spearman ρ correlation coefficient for each pair of the 4 measures was ≥.81, indicating high concurrent validity. The predictive validity of the 4 measures was satisfactory (Spearman ρ, ≥.51). The responsiveness of the 4 measures at 14 to 180 days after stroke was moderate (.52 ≤ effect size ≤ .79). The 4 measures had good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], ≥.92) and test-retest reliability (ICC, ≥.97). Only the minimal detectable changes of the UE-FM (8\% of the highest possible score) and the ARAT (6\%) were satisfactory.The sample size was too small to conduct data analysis according to type or severity of stroke. In addition, the timed component of the Wolf Motor Function Test was not used in this study.All 4 measures showed sufficient validity, responsiveness, and reliability in participants with stroke. The UE-FM for assessing impairment and the ARAT for assessing disability had satisfactory minimal detectable changes, supporting their utility in clinical settings.},

	doi = {10.1097/WCO.0000000000000404},
	abstract = {Purpose of review
Early rehabilitation is recommended in many guidelines, with limited evidence to guide practice. Brain neurobiology suggests that early training, at the right dose, will aid recovery. In this review, we highlight recent trials of early mobilization, aphasia,
dysphagia and upper limb treatment in which intervention is commenced within 7 days of stroke and discuss future research directions.
Recent findings
Trials in this early time window are few. Although the seminal AVERT trial suggests that a cautious approach is necessary immediately
({\textless}24 h) after stroke, early mobility training and mobilization appear well tolerated, with few reasons to delay initiating some rehabilitation within the first week. The results of large clinical trials of early aphasia therapy are on the horizon, and examples of targeted upper limb
treatments with better patient selection are emerging.Summary
Early rehabilitation trials are complex, particularly those that intervene across acute and rehabilitation care settings, but these trials are important if we are to optimize recovery
potential in the critical window for repair. Concerted efforts to standardize ‘early’ recruitment, appropriately stratify participants and implement longer term follow-up is needed. Trial standards are improving. New recommendations from a recent Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation
Roundtable will help drive new research.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review
Despite current rehabilitative strategies, stroke remains a leading cause of disability in the USA. There is a window of enhanced neuroplasticity early after stroke, during which the brain’s dynamic response to injury is heightened and rehabilitation might be particularly effective. This review summarizes the evidence of the existence of this plastic window, and the evidence regarding safety and efficacy of early rehabilitative strategies for several stroke domain-specific deficits.

Recent Findings
Overall, trials of rehabilitation in the first 2 weeks after stroke are scarce. In the realm of very early mobilization, one large and one small trial found potential harm from mobilizing patients within the first 24 h after stroke, and only one small trial found benefit in doing so. For the upper extremity, constraint-induced movement therapy appears to have benefit when started within 2 weeks of stroke. Evidence for non-invasive brain stimulation in the acute period remains scant and inconclusive. For aphasia, the evidence is mixed, but intensive early therapy might be of benefit for patients with severe aphasia. Mirror therapy begun early after stroke shows promise for the alleviation of neglect. Novel approaches to treating dysphagia early after stroke appear promising, but the high rate of spontaneous improvement makes their benefit difficult to gauge.

Summary
The optimal time to begin rehabilitation after a stroke remains unsettled, though the evidence is mounting that for at least some deficits, initiation of rehabilitative strategies within the first 2 weeks of stroke is beneficial. Commencing intensive therapy in the first 24 h may be harmful.},

Criterion validity was investigated using the Pearson?s correlation coefficient (r).Results:Changes from baseline to end of treatment assessed by both tests were significant (P {\textless} 0.001). The value for responsiveness of the S-FMA was significantly higher than that of the S-WMFT (SRM difference, 0.48; 95\% confidence interval, 0.23?0.63). There were stronger associations between the comparison scales and the S-FMA (r = 0.57?0.68) than with the S-WMFT (r = 0.39?0.58).Conclusions:The S-FMA had better concurrent and predictive validity than the S-WMFT and was more sensitive to changes caused by rehabilitation therapies. The S-FMA is recommended for expedited assessment of arm motor function outcome in stroke patients receiving rehabilitative therapy.},

The final aim is to propose guidelines to optimize dynamic biomechanical measurement, considering the measurement uncertainty contribution due to the processing method. Performance of the considered methods are examined and compared with an analytical signal, considering both stationary and transient conditions.

Traditionally, movement smoothness has been computed mainly for discrete movements, in particular arm, reaching and circle drawing, using kinematic data. There are currently very few studies investigating smoothness of rhythmic movements, and there is no systematic way of analysing the smoothness of such movements. There is also very little work on the smoothness of other movement related variables such as force, impedance etc. In this context, this paper presents the first step towards a unified framework for the analysis of smoothness of arbitrary movements and using various data. It starts with a systematic definition of movement smoothness and the different factors that influence smoothness, followed by a review of existing methods for quantifying the smoothness of discrete movements. A method is then introduced to analyse the smoothness of rhythmic movements by generalising the techniques developed for discrete movements. We finally propose recommendations for analysing smoothness of any general sensorimotor behaviour.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolution of motor function during the first months after stroke is stereotypically bifurcated, consisting of either recovery to about 70\% of maximum possible improvement ("proportional recovery, PROP") or in little to no improvement ("poor recovery, POOR"). There is currently no evidence that any rehabilitation treatment will prevent POOR and favor PROP.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a longitudinal and multimodal assessment of functional and structural changes in brain organization associated with PROP.
METHODS: Fugl-Meyer Assessments of the upper extremity and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) were obtained from 63 patients, diffusion tensor imaging from 46 patients, at 2 and 4 weeks (T0) and at 3 months (T1) after stroke onset.
RESULTS: We confirmed the presence of 2 distinct recovery patterns (PROP and POOR) in our sample. At T0, PROP patients had greater integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) and greater EEG functional connectivity (FC) between the affected hemisphere and rest of the brain, in particular between the ventral premotor and the primary motor cortex. POOR patients suffered from degradation of corticocortical and corticofugal fiber tracts in the affected hemisphere between T0 and T1, which was not observed in PROP patients. Better initial CST integrity correlated with greater initial global FC, which was in turn associated with less white matter degradation between T0 and T1.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest links between initial CST integrity, systems-level cortical network plasticity, reduction of white matter atrophy, and clinical motor recovery after stroke. This identifies candidate treatment targets.},

We investigated the microstates in 47 patients who suffered a first-ever mono-lesional ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory and in 20 healthy control volunteers. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at rest with eyes closed was acquired between 2 and 10 days (T0) after ischemic attack. Objective criteria allowed for the selection of an optimal number of microstates. Clinical condition was quantified by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) both in acute (T0) and stabilized (T1, 5.4 ± 1.7 months) phases and Effective Recovery (ER) was calculated as (NIHSS(T1)-NIHSS(T0))/NIHSS(T0). The microstates A, B, C and D emerged as the most stable. In patients with a left lesion inducing a language impairment, microstate C topography differed from controls. Microstate D topography was different in patients with a right lesion inducing neglect symptoms. In patients, the C vs D microstate duration differed after both a left and a right lesion with respect to controls (C lower than D in left and D lower than C in right lesion). A preserved microstate B in acute phase correlated with a better effective recovery. A regression model indicated that the microstate B duration explained the 11\% of ER variance. This first ever study of EEG microstates in acute stroke opens an interesting path to identify neuronal impairments with prognostic relevance, to develop enriched compensatory treatments to drive a better individual recovery.},

	abstract = {Background. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) is a developmental priority for stroke recovery. Objective. To determine whether (1) RSFC differs between stroke survivors based on integrity of descending motor pathways; (2) RSFC is associated with upper-limb behavior in chronic stroke; and (3) the relationship between interhemispheric RSFC and upper-limb behavior differs based on descending motor pathway integrity. Methods. A total of 36 people with stroke (aged 64.4 ± 11.1 years, time since stroke 4.0 ± 2.8 years) and 25 healthy adults (aged 67.3 ± 6.7 years) participated in this study. RSFC was estimated from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Integrity of descending motor pathways was ascertained using transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine motor-evoked potential (MEP) status and magnetic resonance imaging to determine lesion overlap and fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tract (CST). For stroke participants, upper-limb motor behavior was assessed using the Fugl-Meyer test, Action Research Arm Test and grip strength. Results. β-Frequency interhemispheric sensorimotor RSFC was greater for MEP+ stroke participants compared with MEP− (P = .020). There was a significant positive correlation between β RSFC and upper-limb behavior (P = .004) that appeared to be primarily driven by the MEP+ group. A hierarchical regression identified that the addition of β RSFC to measures of CST integrity explained greater variance in upper-limb behavior (R2 change = 0.13; P = .01). Conclusions. This study provides insight to understand the role of EEG-based measures of interhemispheric network activity in chronic stroke. Resting state interhemispheric connectivity was positively associated with upper-limb behavior for stroke survivors where residual integrity of descending motor pathways was maintained.},

Objective. We aimed to investigate (1) the time course of cortical activation as revealed by EEG-based spectral characteristics during awake rest and (2) the development of these spectral characteristics in relation to global neurological and upper-limb motor recovery in the first 6 months poststroke. Methods. Resting-state EEG was measured serially in 41 patients after a first-ever ischemic stroke, within 3 and at 5, 12, and 26 weeks poststroke. We computed the brain symmetry index (BSI) and directional BSI (BSIdir) over different frequency bands (1-25 Hz, delta, theta) and delta/alpha ratio (DAR). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of the upper extremity (FM-UE) were determined as clinical reflections of spontaneous neurobiological recovery. Longitudinal changes in spectral characteristics and within- and between-subject associations with NIHSS and FM-UE were analyzed with linear mixed models. Results. Spectral characteristics showed a gradual normalization over time, within and beyond 12 weeks poststroke. Significant within- and between-subject associations with NIHSS were found for DAR of the affected hemisphere (DARAH) and BSIdirdelta. BSIdirdelta also demonstrated significant within- and between-subject associations with FM-UE. Conclusions. Changes in spectral characteristics are not restricted to the time window of recovery of clinical neurological impairments. The present study suggests that decreasing DARAH and BSIdirdelta reflect improvement of global neurological impairments, whereas BSIdirdelta was also specifically associated with upper-limb motor recovery early poststroke.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Investigate whether resting-state EEG parameters recorded early poststroke can predict upper extremity motor impairment reflected by the Fugl-Meyer motor score (FM-UE) after six months, and whether they have prognostic value in addition to FM-UE at baseline.
Methods
Quantitative EEG parameters delta/alpha ratio (DAR), brain symmetry index (BSI) and directional BSI (BSIdir) were derived from 62-channel resting-state EEG recordings in 39 adults within three weeks after a first-ever ischemic hemispheric stroke. FM-UE scores were acquired within three weeks (FM-UEbaseline) and at 26 weeks poststroke (FM-UEw26). Linear regression analyses were performed using a forward selection procedure to predict FM-UEw26.
Results
BSI calculated over the theta band (BSItheta) (β = −0.40; p = 0.013) was the strongest EEG-based predictor regarding FM-UEw26. BSItheta (β = −0.27; p = 0.006) remained a significant predictor when added to a regression model including FM-UEbaseline, increasing explained variance from 61.5\% to 68.1\%.
Conclusion
Higher BSItheta values, reflecting more power asymmetry over the hemispheres, predict more upper limb motor impairment six months after stroke. Moreover, BSItheta shows additive prognostic value regarding FM-UEw26 next to FM-UEbaseline scores, and thereby contains unique information regarding upper extremity motor recovery.
Significance
To our knowledge, we are the first to show that resting-state EEG parameters can serve as prognostic biomarkers of stroke recovery, in addition to FM-UEbaseline scores.},

	abstract = {Prior studies examining predictors of favorable clinical outcomes after upper limb robot-assisted therapy (RT) have many shortcomings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify meaningful predictors and a prediction model for clinically significant motor improvement in upper limb impairment after RT for each stroke phase. This retrospective, single-center study enrolled patients with stroke who received RT using InMotion2 along with conventional therapy (CT) from January 2015 to September 2019. Demographic characteristics, clinical measures, and robotic kinematic measures were evaluated. The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and we classified patients with improvement more than the minimal clinically important difference as responders for each stroke phase. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between potential predictors and RT responders and determine meaningful predictors. Subsequently, meaningful predictors were included in the final prediction model. One hundred forty-four patients were enrolled. The Hand Movement Scale and time since onset were significant predictors of clinically significant improvement in upper limb impairment (P = 0.045 and 0.043, respectively), as represented by the FMA-UE score after RT along with CT, in patients with subacute stroke. These variables were also meaningful predictors with borderline statistical significance in patients with chronic stroke (P = 0.076 and 0.066, respectively). Better hand movement and a shorter time since onset can be used as realistic predictors of clinically significant motor improvement in upper limb impairment after RT with InMotion2 alongside CT in patients with subacute and chronic stroke. This information may help healthcare professionals discern optimal patients for RT and accurately inform patients and caregivers about outcomes of RT.},

	abstract = {Background. Upper limb robot-assisted therapy (RT) provides intensive, repetitive, and task-specific treatment, and its efficacy for stroke survivors is well established in literature. Biomechanical data from robotic devices has been widely employed for patient’s assessment, but rarely it has been analysed for tracking patient progress during RT. The goal of this retrospective study is to analyse built-in kinematic data registered by a planar end-effector robot for assessing the time course of motor recovery and patient’s workspace exploration skills. A comparison of subjects having mild and severe motor impairment has been also conducted. For that purpose, kinematic data recorded by a planar end-effector robot have been processed for investigating how motor performance in executing point-to-point trajectories with different directions changes during RT. Methods. Observational retrospective study of 68 subacute stroke patients who conducted 20 daily sessions of upper limb RT with the InMotion 2.0 (Bionik Laboratories, USA): planar point-to-point reaching tasks with an “assist as needed” strategy. The following kinematic parameters (KPs) were computed for each subject and for each point-to-point trajectory executed during RT: movement accuracy, movement speed, number of peak speed, and task completion time. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used with clinical outcomes. the Friedman test and post hoc Conover’s test (Bonferroni’s correction) were applied to KPs. A secondary data analysis has been conducted by comparing patients having different severities of motor impairment. The level of significance was set at value {\textless} 0.05. Results. At the RT onset, the movements were less accurate and smoothed, and showed higher times of execution than those executed at the end of treatment. The analysis of the time course of KPs highlighted that RT seems to improve the motor function mainly in the first sessions of treatment: most KPs show significant intersession differences during the first 5/10 sessions. Afterwards, no further significant variations occurred. The ability to perform movements away from the body and from the hemiparetic side remains more challenging. The results obtained from the data stratification show significant differences between subjects with mild and severe motor impairment. Conclusion. Significant improvements in motor performance were registered during the time course of upper limb RT in subacute stroke patients. The outcomes depend on movement direction and motor impairment and pave the way to optimize healthcare resources and to design patient-tailored rehabilitative protocols.},

Randomized controlled trials that were conducted to evaluate the effects of RT on upper extremity motor impairment poststroke and that used Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity scores as an outcome were included. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to pool the effect sizes across the studies.Forty-one randomized controlled trials with 1916 stroke patients were included. Compared with dose-matched conventional rehabilitation, RT significantly improved the Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity scores of the patients with stroke, with a small effect size (Hedges g = 0.25; 95\% CI, 0.11-0.38; I2 = 45.9\%). The subgroup analysis revealed that the effects of unilateral RT, but not that of bilateral RT, were superior to conventional rehabilitation (Hedges g = 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.50; I2 = 55.9\%). Regarding the type of robot devices, the effects of the end effector device (Hedges g = 0.22; 95\% CI, 0.09–0.36; I2 = 35.4\%), but not the exoskeleton device, were superior to conventional rehabilitation. Regarding the stroke stage, the between-group difference (ie, RT vs convention rehabilitation) was significant only for people with late subacute or chronic stroke (Hedges g = 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.50; I2 = 34.2\%).RT might be superior to conventional rehabilitation in improving upper extremity motor impairment in people after stroke with notable upper extremity hemiplegia and limited potential for spontaneous recovery.},

DESIGN: Inception cohort study.
SETTING: Ten acute care hospitals in metropolitan areas of the province of Quebec.
PARTICIPANTS: Persons with first-ever stroke, either ischemic or hemorrhagic. In parallel, a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals without stroke, frequency matched in age and city district, were also recruited.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stroke subjects were interviewed by telephone at 6-month intervals for 2 years of follow-up. The community-dwelling individuals without stroke were also followed.
RESULTS: A total of 434 persons were interviewed approximately 6 months poststroke. Their average age +/- standard deviation was 68.4+/-12.5 years; the average age of the 486 controls was 61.7+/-12.4 years. The stroke group scored on average 90.6/100 on the Barthel Index; 39\% reported a limitation in functional activities, 54\% reported limitations with higher-level activities of daily living such as housework and shopping, and 65\% reported restrictions in reintegration into community activities. By using the Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), persons with stroke rated their physical health 7 points lower than healthy peers; also, 7 of the 8 subscales of the SF-36 were affected by stroke.
CONCLUSION: Almost 50\% of the community-dwelling stroke population lived with sequelae of stroke such that, unless there was a full-time and able-bodied caregiver at home, they needed some form of home help. A large proportion also reported lack of meaningful activity, indicating a need for organized support groups for people with stroke; otherwise, boredom will lead to depression and worsening of function, affect, health status, and QOL.},

Furthermore, amount of real-world arm use appears only weakly correlated with laboratory motor function scales. Therefore, amount of arm use may depend critically on the location, extent, and type of functional gains, which can be quantified with comprehensive kinematic and EMG analysis of ADL performance. Gains in upper extremity function can occur via compensation or recovery of premorbid movement and EMG patterns, and traditional treatment approaches encourage adoption of compensatory strategies early in the postacute period that can inhibit potential recovery. A new treatment approach called Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP) focuses on impairment reduction coupled with repetitive, task-specific training of the paretic arm during ADLs. We present pilot data that show recovery in subjects who received the ASAP, while a usual care control subject showed increased use of compensation over the same period. Finally, we discuss the advantages of data reduction methods such as principal components analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling, which can potentially distill large kinematic and EMG data sets into the key latent variables that predict amount of real-world use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important index of outcome after stroke and may facilitate a broader description of stroke recovery. This study examined the relationship of individual and clinical characteristics to HRQOL in stroke survivors with mild to moderate stroke during subacute recovery.
METHODS: Two hundred twenty-nine participants 3 to 9 months poststroke were enrolled in a national multisite clinical trial (Extremity Constraint-Induced Therapy Evaluation). HRQOL was assessed using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Version 3.0. The Wolf Motor Function Test documented functional recovery of the hemiplegic upper extremity. Multiple analysis of variance and regression models examined the influence of demographic and clinical variables across SIS domains.
RESULTS: Age, gender, education level, stroke type, concordance (paretic arm=dominant hand), upper extremity motor function (Wolf Motor Function Test), and comorbidities were associated across SIS domains. Poorer HRQOL in the physical domain was associated with age, nonwhite race, more comorbidities, and reduced upper-extremity function. Stroke survivors with more comorbidities reported poorer HRQOL in the area of memory and thinking, and those with an ischemic stroke and concordance reported poorer communication.
CONCLUSIONS: Although results may not generalize to lower functioning stroke survivors, individual characteristics of persons with mild to moderate stroke may be important to consider in developing comprehensive, targeted interventions designed to maximize recovery and improve HRQOL.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12984-018-0428-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large number of robotic or gravity-supporting devices have been developed for rehabilitation of upper extremity post-stroke. Because these devices continuously monitor performance data during training, they could potentially help to develop predictive models of the effects of motor training on recovery. However, during training with such devices, patients must become adept at using the new "tool" of the exoskeleton, including learning the new forces and visuomotor transformations associated with the device. We thus hypothesized that the changes in performance during extensive training with a passive, gravity-supporting, exoskeleton device (the Armeo Spring) will follow an initial fast phase, due to learning to use the device, and a slower phase that corresponds to reduction in overall arm impairment. Of interest was whether these fast and slow processes were related.
METHODS: To test the two-process hypothesis, we used mixed-effect exponential models to identify putative fast and slow changes in smoothness of arm movements during 80 arm reaching tests performed during 20 days of exoskeleton training in 53 individuals with post-acute stroke.
RESULTS: In line with our hypothesis, we found that double exponential models better fit the changes in smoothness of arm movements than single exponential models. In contrast, single exponential models better fit the data for a group of young healthy control subjects. In addition, in the stroke group, we showed that smoothness correlated with a measure of impairment (the upper extremity Fugl Meyer score - UEFM) at the end, but not at the beginning, of training. Furthermore, the improvement in movement smoothness due to the slow component, but not to the fast component, strongly correlated with the improvement in the UEFM between the beginning and end of training. There was no correlation between the change of peaks due to the fast process and the changes due to the slow process. Finally, the improvement in smoothness due to the slow, but not the fast, component correlated with the number of days since stroke at the onset of training - i.e. participants who started exoskeleton training sooner after stroke improved their smoothness more.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore demonstrate that at least two processes are involved in in performance improvements measured during mechanized training post-stroke. The fast process is consistent with learning to use the exoskeleton, while the slow process independently reflects the reduction in upper extremity impairment.},

	abstract = {The quality of arm movements typically improves in the sub-acute phase of stroke affecting the upper extremity. Here, we used whole arm kinematic analysis during reaching movements to distinguish whether these improvements are due to true recovery or to compensation. Fifty-three participants with post-acute stroke performed ∼80 reaching movement tests during 4 weeks of training with the ArmeoSpring exoskeleton. All participants showed improvements in end-effector performance, as measured by movement smoothness. Four ArmeoSpring angles, shoulder horizontal (SH) rotation, shoulder elevation (SE), elbow rotation, and forearm rotation, were recorded and analyzed. We first characterized healthy joint coordination patterns by performing a sparse principal component analysis on these four joint velocities recorded during reaching tests performed by young control participants. We found that two dominant joint correlations [SH with elbow rotation and SE with forearm rotation] explained over 95\% of variance of joint velocity data. We identified two clusters of stroke participants by comparing the evolution of these two correlations in all tests. In the “Recoverer” cluster (N = 19), both joint correlations converged toward the respective correlations for control participants. Thus, Recoverers relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements while developing joint movement patterns similar to those of control participants. In the “Compensator” cluster (N = 34), at least one of the two joint correlations diverged from the corresponding correlation of control participants. Compensators relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements by discovering various new compensatory movement patterns dissimilar to those of control participants. New compensatory patterns included atypical decoupling of the SE and forearm joints, and atypical coupling of the SH rotation and elbow joints. There was no difference in clinical impairment level between the two groups either at the onset or at the end of training as assessed with the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer scale. However, at the start of training, the Recoverers showed significantly faster improvements in end-effector movement smoothness than the Compensators. Our analysis can be used to inform neurorehabilitation clinicians on how to provide movement feedback during practice and suggest avenues for refining exoskeleton robot therapy to reduce compensatory patterns.},

	abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of permanent disability in developed countries; its effects may include sensory, motor, and cognitive impairment as well as a reduced ability to perform self-care and participate in social and community activities. A number of studies have shown that the use of robotic systems in upper limb motor rehabilitation programs provides safe and intensive treatment to patients with motor impairments because of a neurological injury. Furthermore, robot-aided therapy was shown to be well accepted and tolerated by all patients; however, it is not known whether a specific robot-aided rehabilitation can induce beneficial cortical plasticity in stroke patients. Here, we present a procedure to study neural underpinning of robot-aided upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients. Neurophysiological recordings use the following: (a) 10-20 system electroencephalographic (EEG) electrode montage; (b) bipolar vertical and horizontal electrooculographies; and (c) bipolar electromyography from the operating upper limb. Behavior monitoring includes the following: (a) clinical data and (b) kinematic and dynamic of the operant upper limb movements. Experimental conditions include the following: (a) resting state eyes closed and eyes open, and (b) robotic rehabilitation task (maximum 80 s each block to reach 4-min EEG data; interblock pause of 1 min). The data collection is performed before and after a program of 30 daily rehabilitation sessions. EEG markers include the following: (a) EEG power density in the eyes-closed condition; (b) reactivity of EEG power density to eyes opening; and (c) reactivity of EEG power density to robotic rehabilitation task. The above procedure was tested on a subacute patient (29 poststroke days) and on a chronic patient (21 poststroke months). After the rehabilitation program, we observed (a) improved clinical condition; (b) improved performance during the robotic task; (c) reduced delta rhythms (1-4 Hz) and increased alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) during the resting state eyes-closed condition; (d) increased alpha desynchronization to eyes opening; and (e) decreased alpha desynchronization during the robotic rehabilitation task. We conclude that the present procedure is suitable for evaluation of the neural underpinning of robot-aided upper limb rehabilitation.},

This study addresses selected psychometric attributes of the WMFT applied to a chronic stroke population.
METHODS: Nineteen individuals after stroke and with intact cognition and sitting balance were age- and sex-matched with 19 individuals without impairment. Subjects performed the WMFT and the upper extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA) on 2 occasions (12 to 16 days apart), with scoring performed independently by 2 random raters.
RESULTS: The WMFT and FMA demonstrated agreement (P{\textless}0.0001) between raters at each session. WMFT scores for the dominant and nondominant extremities of individuals without impairment were different (P{\textless}/=0.05) from the more and less affected extremities of subjects after stroke. The FMA score for the more affected extremity of subjects after stroke was different (P{\textless}/=0.05) from the dominant and nondominant extremities. However, the FMA score for the less affected upper extremity of individuals after stroke was not different (P{\textgreater}0.05) from the dominant and nondominant extremities of individuals without impairment. The WMFT and FMA scores were related (P{\textless}0.02) for the more affected extremity in individuals after stroke.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of robot-assisted training using end-effector and exoskeleton robots on UL function following a stroke in real-life clinical practice.
METHODS: A total of 105 patients affected by a first-ever supratentorial stroke were enrolled in 18 neurorehabilitation centers and treated with electromechanically assisted arm training as an add-on to conventional therapy. Both interventions provided either an exoskeleton or an end-effector device (as per clinical practice) and consisted of 20 sessions (3/5 times per week; 6-8 weeks). Patients were assessed by validated UL scales at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and at three-month follow-up (T2). The primary outcome was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the upper extremity (FMA-UE).
RESULTS: FMA-UE improved at T1 by 6 points on average in the end-effector group and 11 points on average in the exoskeleton group (p {\textless} 0.0001). Exoskeletons were more effective in the subacute phase, whereas the end-effectors were more effective in the chronic phase (p {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: robot-assisted training might help improve UL function in stroke patients as an add-on treatment in both subacute and chronic stages. Pragmatic and highmethodological studies are needed to confirm the showed effectiveness of the exoskeleton and end-effector devices.},

	abstract = {Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is a physical rehabilitation regime that has been previously shown to improve motor function in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients. However, the neural mechanisms supporting rehabilitation-induced motor recovery are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to assess motor cortical reorganization after CIMT using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a repeated-measures design, 4 incompletely recovered chronic stroke patients treated with CIMT underwent motor function testing and fMRI. Five age-matched normal subjects were also imaged. A laterality index (LI) was determined from the fMRI data, reflecting the distribution of activation in motor cortices contralateral compared with ipsilateral to the moving hand. Pre-intervention fMRI showed a lower LI during affected hand movement of stroke patients (LI = 0.23+/-0.07) compared to controls (LI unaffected patient hand = 0.65+/-0.10; LI dominant normal hand = 0.65+/-0.11; LI nondominant normal hand = 0.69+/-0.11; P {\textless} 0.05) due to trends toward increased ipsilateral motor cortical activation. Motor function testing showed that patients made significant gains in functional use of the stroke-affected upper extremity (detected by the Motor Activity Log) and significant reductions in motor impairment (detected by the Fugl-Meyer Stroke Scale and the Wolf Motor Function Test) immediately after CIMT, and these effects persisted at 6-month follow-up. The behavioral effects of CIMT were associated with a trend toward a reduced LI from pre-intervention to immediately post-intervention (LI = -0.01+/-0.06, P = 0.077) and 6 months post-intervention (LI = -0.03+/-0.15). Stroke-affected hand movement was not accompanied by mirror movements during fMRI, and electromyographic measures of mirror recruitment under simulated fMRI conditions were not correlated with LI values. These data provide preliminary evidence that gains in motor function produced by CIMT in chronic stroke patients may be associated with a shift in laterality of motor cortical activation toward the undamaged hemisphere.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Motor learning is relevant in chronic stroke for acquiring compensatory strategies to motor control deficits. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motor skill acquisition with the paretic upper limb have received little systematic investigation. The aim of this study was to assess the modulation of corticomotor excitability and intracortical inhibition within ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) during motor skill learning.
METHODS: Ten people at the chronic stage after stroke and twelve healthy controls trained on a sequential visuomotor isometric wrist extension task. Skill was quantified before, immediately after, 24 hours and 7 days post-training. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to examine corticomotor excitability and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) pre- and post-training.
RESULTS: The patient group exhibited successful skill acquisition and retention, although absolute skill level was lower compared with controls. In contrast to controls, patients' ipsilesional corticomotor excitability was not modulated during skill acquisition, which may be attributed to excessive ipsilesional LICI relative to controls. SICI decreased after training for both patient and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate distinct inhibitory networks within M1 that may be relevant for motor learning after stroke.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings have potential clinical relevance for neurorehabilitation adjuvants aimed at augmenting the recovery of motor function.},

Recent literature suggests to apply a stratification based on lesion location and to consider patients with cortico-subcortical and subcortical strokes separately: different lesion location may also influence therapeutic response. In this study we used a longitudinal approach to perform TMS assessment (Motor Evoked Potentials, MEP, and Silent Period, SP) and clinical evaluations (Barthel Index, Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper limb motor function and Wolf Motor Function Test) in 10 cortical-subcortical and 10 subcortical ischemic stroke patients. Evaluations were performed in a window between 10 and 45 days (t0) and at 3 months after the acute event (t1). Our main finding is that 3 months after the acute event patients affected by subcortical stroke presented a reduction in contralateral SP duration in the unaffected hemisphere; this trend is related to clinical improvement of upper limb motor function. In conclusion, SP proved to be a valid parameter to characterize cortical reorganization patterns in stroke survivors and provided useful information about motor recovery within 3 months in subcortical patients.},

	abstract = {Brain lesions caused by cerebral ischemia lead to network disturbances in both hemispheres, causing a subsequent reorganization of functional connectivity both locally and remotely with respect to the injury. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods have long been used for exploring brain electrical activity and functional connectivity modifications after stroke. However, results obtained so far are not univocal. Here, we used basic and advanced EEG methods to characterize how brain activity and functional connectivity change after stroke. Thirty-three unilateral post stroke patients in the sub-acute phase and ten neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Patients were subdivided into two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, n = 18) and subcortical (S, n = 15), respectively. Stroke patients were evaluated in the period ranging from 45 days since the acute event (T0) up to 3 months after stroke (T1) with both neurophysiological (resting state EEG) and clinical assessment (Barthel Index, BI) measures, while healthy subjects were evaluated once. Brain power at T0 was similar between the two groups of patients in all frequency bands considered (δ, θ, α, and β). However, evolution of θ-band power over time was different, with a normalization only in the CS group. Instead, average connectivity and specific network measures (Integration, Segregation, and Small-worldness) in the β-band at T0 were significantly different between the two groups. The connectivity and network measures at T0 also appear to have a predictive role in functional recovery (BI T1-T0), again group-dependent. The results obtained in this study showed that connectivity measures and correlations between EEG features and recovery depend on lesion location. These data, if confirmed in further studies, on the one hand could explain the heterogeneity of results so far observed in previous studies, on the other hand they could be used by researchers as biomarkers predicting spontaneous recovery, to select homogenous groups of patients for the inclusion in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Stroke is the most common cause of physical disability in the world today. While the key element of rehabilitative therapy is training, there is currently much interest in approaches that "prime" the primary motor cortex to be more excitable, thereby increasing the likelihood of experience-dependent plasticity. Cortical oscillations reflect the balance of excitation and inhibition, itself a key determinant of the potential for experience-dependent plasticity. In the motor system, beta-band oscillations are important and are thought to maintain the resting sensorimotor state. Here we examined motor cortex beta oscillations during rest and unimanual movement in a group of stroke patients and healthy control subjects, using magnetoencephalography. Movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD) in contralateral primary motor cortex was found to be significantly reduced in patients compared with control subjects. Within the patient group, smaller MRBD was seen in those with more motor impairment. We speculate that impaired modulation of beta oscillations during affected hand grip is detrimental to motor control, highlighting this as a potential therapeutic target in neurorehabilitation.},

Numerous outcomes from hundreds of patients collectively indicate that (sub-)acute QEEG indices from standard systems can uniquely inform clinical management, particularly prognostication of outcomes from IS. Two classes of QEEG indices have proven particularly informative. The first quantifies the power of abnormal, slow activity relative to that of faster activity and the second, interhemispheric voltage asymmetry (broadband). Both have been identified as statistically significant predictors of outcomes assessed (via routine clinical scales) in the weeks and months following IS. Furthermore both have demonstrated higher predictive value than concomitant neurological assessments and scales, and to improve upon outcome prediction afforded by neuroimaging alone. These indices also may continuously provide unique, real-time insights into the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy, prior to clinical changes. Two key applications of QEEG which should prove valuable for future clinical management of IS are: (1) continuous, acute monitoring to inform about the efficacy of thrombolysis and decisions about potential additional interventions, and; (2) brief, subacute recording to inform outcome prognostication and clinical decisions about, for example, rehabilitation strategies. Ongoing research and technological developments will continue to facilitate clinical translation of QEEG investigations reviewed herein.},

The robot-measured kinematic data can assess the biomechanical changes induced by ulRT and the progress of patient over time. However, literature on the analysis of pre-treatment kinematic parameters as predictive biomarkers of upper limb recovery is limited.Objective: The aim of this study was to calculate pre-treatment kinematic parameters from point-to-point reaching movements in different directions and to identify biomarkers of upper-limb motor recovery in subacute stroke subjects after ulRT.Methods: An observational retrospective study was conducted on 66 subacute stroke subjects who underwent ulRT with an end-effector robot. Kinematic parameters were calculated from the robot-measured trajectories during movements in different directions. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was applied considering the post-treatment Upper Limb Motricity Index and the kinematic parameters (from demanding directions of movement) as dependent variables, and the pre-treatment kinematic parameters as independent variables.Results: A subset of kinematic parameters significantly predicted the motor impairment after ulRT: the accuracy in adduction and internal rotation movements of the shoulder was the major predictor of post-treatment Upper Limb Motricity Index. The post-treatment kinematic parameters of the most demanding directions of movement significantly depended on the ability to execute elbow flexion-extension and abduction and external rotation movements of the shoulder at baseline.Conclusions: The multidirectional analysis of robot-measured kinematic data predicts motor recovery in subacute stroke survivors and paves the way in identifying subjects who may benefit more from ulRT.},

Without answers to these questions, clinicians struggle to make decisions regarding the content and focus of therapy, and researchers design studies that inadvertently mix participants who have a high likelihood of responding with those who do not. Developing and implementing biomarkers that distinguish patient subgroups will help address these issues and unravel the factors important to the recovery process. The goal of the present paper is to provide a consensus statement regarding the current state of the evidence for stroke recovery biomarkers. Biomarkers of motor, somatosensory, cognitive and language domains across the recovery timeline post-stroke are considered; with focus on brain structure and function, and exclusion of blood markers and genetics. We provide evidence for biomarkers that are considered ready to be included in clinical trials, as well as others that are promising but not ready and so represent a developmental priority. We conclude with an example that illustrates the utility of biomarkers in recovery and rehabilitation research, demonstrating how the inclusion of a biomarker may enhance future clinical trials. In this way, we propose a way forward for when and where we can include biomarkers to advance the efficacy of the practice of, and research into, rehabilitation and recovery after stroke.},

Robot therapy may represent a valid option for upper limb stroke rehabilitation, but there are still gaps between research evidence and their use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to determine the quality, scope, and consistency of guidelines clinical practice recommendations for upper limb robotic rehabilitation in stroke populations.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched for guideline recommendations on stroke published between January 1st, 2010 and January 1st, 2020. Only the most recent guidelines for writing group were selected. Electronic databases (N.=4), guideline repertories and professional rehabilitation networks (N.=12) were searched. We systematically reviewed and assessed guidelines containing recommendation statements about upper limb robotic rehabilitation for adults with stroke (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020173386).
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Four independent reviewers used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument, and textual syntheses were used to appraise and compare recommendations. From 1324 papers that were screened, eight eligible guidelines were identified from six different regions/countries. Half of the included guidelines focused on stroke management, the other half on stroke rehabilitation. Rehabilitation assisted by robotic devices is generally recommended to improve upper limb motor function and strength. The exact characteristics of patients who could benefit from this treatment as well as the correct timing to use it are not known.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review has identified many opportunities to modernize and otherwise improve stroke patients' upper limb robotic therapy. Rehabilitation assisted by robot or electromechanical devices for stroke needs to be improved in clinical practice guidelines in particular in terms of applicability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper-limb robotic-assisted therapy (RAT) is promising for stroke rehabilitation, particularly in the early phase. When RAT is provided as partial substitution of conventional therapy, it is expected to be at least as effective or might be more effective than conventional therapy. Assessments have usually been restricted to the first 2 domains of the International classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF).
OBJECTIVE: This was a pragmatic, multicentric, single-blind, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of upper-limb RAT used as partial substitution to conventional therapy in the early phase of stroke rehabilitation, following the 3 ICF domains.
METHODS: We randomized 45 patients with acute stroke into 2 groups (conventional therapy, n=22, and RAT, n=23). Both interventions were dose-matched regarding treatment duration and lasted 9 weeks. The conventional therapy group followed a standard rehabilitation. In the RAT group, 4 sessions of conventional therapy (25\%) were substituted by RAT each week. RAT consisted of moving the paretic upper limb along a reference trajectory while the robot provided assistance as needed. A blinded assessor evaluated participants before, just after the intervention and 6 months post-stroke, according to the ICF domains UL motor impairments, activity limitations, and social participation restriction.
RESULTS: In total, 28 individuals were assessed after the intervention. The following were more improved in the RAT than conventional therapy group at 6 months post-stroke: gross manual dexterity (Box and Block test +7.7 blocks; P=0.02), upper-limb ability during functional tasks (Wolf Motor Function test +12\%; P=0.02) and patient social participation (Stroke Impact Scale +18\%; P=0.01). Participants' abilities to perform manual activities and activities of daily living improved similarly in both groups.
CONCLUSION: For the same duration of daily rehabilitation, RAT combined with conventional therapy during the early rehabilitation phase after stroke is more effective than conventional therapy alone to improve gross manual dexterity, upper-limb ability during functional tasks and patient social participation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Much of neurorehabilitation rests on the assumption that patients can improve with practice. This review will focus on arm movements and address the following questions: (i) What is motor learning? (ii) Do patients with hemiparesis have a learning deficit? (iii) Is recovery after injury a form of motor learning? (iv) Are approaches based on motor learning principles useful for rehabilitation?
RECENT FINDINGS: Motor learning can be broken into kinematic and dynamic components. Studies in healthy subjects suggest that retention of motor learning is best accomplished with variable training schedules. Animal models and functional imaging in humans show that the mature brain can undergo plastic changes during both learning and recovery. Quantitative motor control approaches allow differentiation between compensation and true recovery, although both improve with practice. Several promising new rehabilitation approaches are based on theories of motor learning. These include impairment oriented-training (IOT), constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), electromyogram (EMG)-triggered neuromuscular stimulation, robotic interactive therapy and virtual reality (VR).
SUMMARY: Motor learning mechanisms are operative during spontaneous stroke recovery and interact with rehabilitative training. For optimal results, rehabilitation techniques should be geared towards patients' specific motor deficits and possibly combined, for example, CIMT with VR. Two critical questions that should always be asked of a rehabilitation technique are whether gains persist for a significant period after training and whether they generalize to untrained tasks.},

Substantial advances are yet to be made in stroke rehabilitation practice to meet this demand and improve patient outcomes relative to current care. Several large intervention trials targeting motor recovery report that participants' motor performance improved, but to a similar extent for both the intervention and control groups in most trials. These neutral results might reflect an absence of additional benefit from the tested interventions or the many challenges of designing and doing large stroke rehabilitation trials. Strategies for improving trial quality include new approaches to the selection of patients, control interventions, and endpoint measures. Although stroke rehabilitation research strives for better trials, interventions, and outcomes, rehabilitation practices continue to help patients regain independence after stroke.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regularly updated data on stroke and its pathological types, including data on their incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability, risk factors, and epidemiological trends, are important for evidence-based stroke care planning and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) aims to provide a standardised and comprehensive measurement of these metrics at global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: We applied GBD 2019 analytical tools to calculate stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of DALYs (with corresponding 95\% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) associated with 19 risk factors, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. These estimates were provided for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and all strokes combined, and stratified by sex, age group, and World Bank country income level.
FINDINGS: In 2019, there were 12·2 million (95\% UI 11·0-13·6) incident cases of stroke, 101 million (93·2-111) prevalent cases of stroke, 143 million (133-153) DALYs due to stroke, and 6·55 million (6·00-7·02) deaths from stroke. Globally, stroke remained the second-leading cause of death (11·6\% [10·8-12·2] of total deaths) and the third-leading cause of death and disability combined (5·7\% [5·1-6·2] of total DALYs) in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the absolute number of incident strokes increased by 70·0\% (67·0-73·0), prevalent strokes increased by 85·0\% (83·0-88·0), deaths from stroke increased by 43·0\% (31·0-55·0), and DALYs due to stroke increased by 32·0\% (22·0-42·0). During the same period, age-standardised rates of stroke incidence decreased by 17·0\% (15·0-18·0), mortality decreased by 36·0\% (31·0-42·0), prevalence decreased by 6·0\% (5·0-7·0), and DALYs decreased by 36·0\% (31·0-42·0). However, among people younger than 70 years, prevalence rates increased by 22·0\% (21·0-24·0) and incidence rates increased by 15·0\% (12·0-18·0). In 2019, the age-standardised stroke-related mortality rate was 3·6 (3·5-3·8) times higher in the World Bank low-income group than in the World Bank high-income group, and the age-standardised stroke-related DALY rate was 3·7 (3·5-3·9) times higher in the low-income group than the high-income group. Ischaemic stroke constituted 62·4\% of all incident strokes in 2019 (7·63 million [6·57-8·96]), while intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 27·9\% (3·41 million [2·97-3·91]) and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 9·7\% (1·18 million [1·01-1·39]). In 2019, the five leading risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood pressure (contributing to 79·6 million [67·7-90·8] DALYs or 55·5\% [48·2-62·0] of total stroke DALYs), high body-mass index (34·9 million [22·3-48·6] DALYs or 24·3\% [15·7-33·2]), high fasting plasma glucose (28·9 million [19·8-41·5] DALYs or 20·2\% [13·8-29·1]), ambient particulate matter pollution (28·7 million [23·4-33·4] DALYs or 20·1\% [16·6-23·0]), and smoking (25·3 million [22·6-28·2] DALYs or 17·6\% [16·4-19·0]).
INTERPRETATION: The annual number of strokes and deaths due to stroke increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, despite substantial reductions in age-standardised rates, particularly among people older than 70 years. The highest age-standardised stroke-related mortality and DALY rates were in the World Bank low-income group. The fastest-growing risk factor for stroke between 1990 and 2019 was high body-mass index. Without urgent implementation of effective primary prevention strategies, the stroke burden will probably continue to grow across the world, particularly in low-income countries.

Body function was assessed by palmar grip and pinch strength; Ashworth modified scale; Fugl-Meyer scale; and Motor-Free Visual Perception Test. The Purdue Pegboard Test and the aiming movement performance measured the activity. Upper limb participation was analyzed by the Hand Function domain of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). Thirty-four individuals after chronic stroke were divided into two groups, according to their Hand function SIS scores (severe and non-severe). Differences between groups were analyzed. Relationships between individual variables and the SIS score were verified. A regression model was proposed.ResultsStrength and the Fugl-Meyer scale score were greater for the non-severe group. Muscle tone was greater for the severe group only in the wrist flexors. None of the activity variables differed between groups. The upper limb Fugl-Meyer score was able to predict 79\% of the individuals in SIS Hand Function groups.ConclusionSensory-motor impairment, as measured by the upper limb Fugl-Meyer scale, can explain the influence of the upper limbs on participation in the individuals’ perception.},

	abstract = {A key principle of brain organization is the functional integration of brain regions into interconnected networks. Functional MRI scans acquired at rest offer insights into functional integration via patterns of coherent fluctuations in spontaneous activity, known as functional connectivity. These patterns have been studied intensively and have been linked to cognition and disease. However, the field is fractionated. Diverging analysis approaches have segregated the community into research silos, limiting the replication and clinical translation of findings. A primary source of this fractionation is the diversity of approaches used to reduce complex brain data into a lower-dimensional set of features for analysis and interpretation, which we refer to as brain representations. In this Primer, we provide an overview of different brain representations, lay out the challenges that have led to the fractionation of the field and that continue to form obstacles for convergence, and propose concrete guidelines to unite the field.},

A group analysis toolbox allows the user to run a variety of inferential statistics on their data in an easy-to-use GUI-driven format. Importantly, NUTMEG features an interactive five-dimensional data visualization platform. A key feature of NUTMEG is the availability of a large menu of interference cancelation and source reconstruction algorithms. Each NUTMEG operation acts as a stand-alone MATLAB function, allowing the package to be easily adaptable and scripted for the more advanced user for interoperability with other software toolboxes.

	abstract = {Purpose: To use structural magnetic resonance (MR) images to identify a pattern of regional atrophy characteristic of mild Alzheimer disease (AD) and to investigate whether presence of this pattern prospectively can aid prediction of 1-year clinical decline and increased structural loss in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval and compliance with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. High-throughput volumetric segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction methods were applied to MR images from 84 subjects with mild AD, 175 with MCI, and 139 healthy control (HC) subjects. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis was used to identify regions that best can aid discrimination of HC subjects from subjects with AD. A classifier trained on data from HC subjects and those with AD was applied to data from subjects with MCI to determine whether presence of phenotypic AD atrophy at baseline was predictive of clinical decline and structural loss.

Results: Atrophy in mesial and lateral temporal, isthmus cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas aided discrimination of HC subjects from subjects with AD, with fully cross-validated sensitivity of 83\% and specificity of 93\%. Subjects with MCI who had phenotypic AD atrophy showed significantly greater 1-year clinical decline and structural loss than those who did not and were more likely to have progression to probable AD (annual progression rate of 29\% for subjects with MCI who had AD atrophy vs 8\% for those who did not).

Conclusion: Semiautomated, individually specific quantitative MR imaging methods can be used to identify a pattern of regional atrophy in MCI that is predictive of clinical decline. Such information may aid in prediction of patient prognosis and increase the efficiency of clinical trials.

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases is a key confound to disease understanding and treatment development, as study cohorts typically include multiple phenotypes on distinct disease trajectories. Here we introduce a machine-learning technique—Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn)—able to uncover data-driven disease phenotypes with distinct temporal progression patterns, from widely available cross-sectional patient studies. Results from imaging studies in two neurodegenerative diseases reveal subgroups and their distinct trajectories of regional neurodegeneration. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, SuStaIn identifies genotypes from imaging alone, validating its ability to identify subtypes; further the technique reveals within-genotype heterogeneity. In Alzheimer’s disease, SuStaIn uncovers three subtypes, uniquely characterising their temporal complexity. SuStaIn provides fine-grained patient stratification, which substantially enhances the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories over standard models that ignore subtype (p = 7.18 × 10−4) or temporal stage (p = 3.96 × 10−5). SuStaIn offers new promise for enabling disease subtype discovery and precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Background
The improvement of health indicators and life expectancy, especially in developed countries, has led to population growth and increased age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the early detection of AD is valuable to stop its progress at an early stage.
Method
This study systematically reviewed the current state of using deep learning methods on neuroimaging data for timely diagnose of AD. We reviewed different deep models, modalities, feature extraction strategies, and parameter initialization methods to find out which model or strategy could offer better performance.
Results
Our search in eight different databases resulted in 736 studies, from which 74 studies were included to be reviewed for data analysis. Most studies have reported the normal control (NC)/AD classification and have shown desirable results. Although recent studies showed promising results of utilizing deep models on the NC/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and NC/early MCI (eMCI), other classification groups should be taken into consideration and improved.
Discussion
The results of our review indicate that the comparative analysis is challenging in this area due to the lack of a benchmark platform; however, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models, especially in an ensemble way, seem to perform better than other deep models. The transfer learning approach also could efficiently improve the performance and time complexity. Further research on designing a benchmark platform to facilitate the comparative analysis is recommended.},

Advanced machine learning methods might help to identify dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
Methods
We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for machine learning studies differentiating healthy aging from dementia of various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different disease boundaries.
Results
Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease versus healthy controls, using AD Neuroimaging Initiative data, support vector machines, and only T1-weighted sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls and poor for differentiating healthy controls versus mild cognitive impairment versus Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment converters versus nonconverters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by data source, sample size, or machine learning method.
Discussion
Machine learning does not differentiate clinically relevant disease categories yet. More diverse data sets, combinations of different types of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to advance the field.},

	abstract = {Upper limb function, essential for daily life, is often impaired in individuals after stroke and cerebral palsy (CP). For an improved upper limb function, learning should occur, and therefore training with motor learning principles is included in many rehabilitation interventions. Despite accurate measurement being an important aspect for examination and optimization of treatment outcomes, there are no standard algorithms for outcome measures selection. Moreover, the ability of the chosen measures to identify learning is not well established. We aimed to review and categorize the parameters and measures utilized for identification of motor learning in stroke and CP populations. PubMed, Pedro, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched between January 2000 and March 2016 for studies assessing a form of motor learning following upper extremity training using motor control measures. Thirty-two studies in persons after stroke and 10 studies in CP of any methodological quality were included. Identified outcome measures were sorted into two categories, "parameters," defined as identifying a form of learning, and "measures," as tools measuring the parameter. Review's results were organized as a narrative synthesis focusing on the outcome measures. The included studies were heterogeneous in their study designs, parameters and measures. Parameters included adaptation (n = 6), anticipatory control (n = 2), after-effects (n = 3), de-adaptation (n = 4), performance (n = 24), acquisition (n = 8), retention (n = 8), and transfer (n = 14). Despite motor learning theory's emphasis on long-lasting changes and generalization, the majority of studies did not assess the retention and transfer parameters. Underlying measures included kinematic analyses in terms of speed, geometry or both (n = 39), dynamic metrics, measures of accuracy, consistency, and coordination. There is no exclusivity of measures to a specific parameter. Many factors affect task performance and the ability to measure it-necessitating the use of several metrics to examine different features of movement and learning. Motor learning measures' applicability to clinical setting can benefit from a treatment-focused approach, currently lacking. The complexity of motor learning results in various metrics, utilized to assess its occurrence, making it difficult to synthesize findings across studies. Further research is desirable for development of an outcome measures selection algorithm, while considering the quality of such measurements.},

	abstract = {Background. Recovery of upper limb function post-stroke can be partly predicted by initial motor function, but the mechanisms underpinning these improvements have yet to be determined. Here, we sought to identify neural correlates of post-stroke recovery using longitudinal magnetoencephalography (MEG) assessments in subacute stroke survivors. Methods. First-ever, subcortical ischemic stroke survivors with unilateral mild to moderate hand paresis were evaluated at 3, 5, and 12 weeks after stroke using a finger-lifting task in the MEG. Cortical activity patterns in the β-band (16-30 Hz) were compared with matched healthy controls. Results. All stroke survivors (n=22; 17 males) had improvements in action research arm test (ARAT) and Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (FM-UE) scores between 3 and 12 weeks. At 3 weeks post-stroke the peak amplitudes of the movement-related ipsilesional β-band event-related desynchronization (β-ERD) and synchronization (β-ERS) in primary motor cortex (M1) were significantly lower than the healthy controls (p{\textless}0.001) and were correlated with both the FM-UE and ARAT scores (r=0.51-0.69, p{\textless}0.017). The decreased β-ERS peak amplitudes were observed both in paretic and non-paretic hand movement particularly at 3 weeks post-stroke, suggesting a generalized disinhibition status. The peak amplitudes of ipsilesional β-ERS at week 3 post-stroke correlated with the FM-UE score at 12 weeks (r=0.54, p=0.03) but no longer significant when controlling for the FM-UE score at 3 weeks post-stroke.Conclusions. Although early β-band activity does not independently predict outcome at 3 months after stroke, it mirrors functional changes, giving a potential insight into the mechanisms underpinning recovery of motor function in subacute stroke.},

	abstract = {The identification of individual factors modulating clinical recovery after a stroke is fundamental to personalize the therapeutic intervention to enhance the final clinical outcome. In this framework, electrophysiological factors are promising since are more directly related to neuroplasticity, which supports recovery in stroke patients, than neurovascular factors. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated brain neuronal activity assessed via spectral features and Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD) of electroencephalographic signals in acute phase (2–10 days from symptom onset, T0) and sub-acute phase (2.5 months, T1) in 24 patients affected by unilateral middle cerebral artery stroke. Longitudinal assessment of the clinical deficits was performed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), together with the effective recovery calculated as the ratio between difference of NIHSS at T0 and T1 over the NIHSS value at T0. We observed that delta and alpha band electroencephalographic signal power changed between the two phases in both the hemispheres ipsilateral (ILH) and contralateral (CHL) to the lesion. Moreover, at T0, bilateral higher delta band power correlated with worse clinical conditions (Spearman’s rs = 0.460, P = 0.027 for ILH and rs = 0.508, P = 0.013 for CLH), whereas at T1 this occurred only for delta power in ILH (rs = 0.411, P = 0.046) and not for CHL. Inter-hemispheric difference (ILH vs. CLH) of alpha power in patients was lower at T0 than at T1 (P = 0.020). HFD at T0 was lower than at T1 (P = 0.005), and at both phases, ILH HFD was lower than CLH HFD (P = 0.020). These data suggest that inter-hemispheric low band asymmetry and fractal dimension changes from the acute to the sub-acute phase are sensitive to neuroplasticity processes which subtend clinical recovery.

	abstract = {BackgroundBrain–computer interface (BCI) has been regarded as a newly developing intervention in promoting motor recovery in stroke survivors. Several studies have been performed in chronic stroke to explore its clinical and subclinical efficacy. However, evidence in subacute stroke was poor, and the longitudinal sensorimotor rhythm changes in subacute stroke after BCI with exoskeleton feedback were still unclear.Materials and MethodsFourteen stroke patients in subacute stage were recruited and randomly allocated to BCI group (n = 7) and the control group (n = 7). Brain–computer interface training with exoskeleton feedback was applied in the BCI group three times a week for 4 weeks. The Fugl–Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) scale was used to assess motor function improvement. Brain–computer interface performance was calculated across the 12-time interventions. Sensorimotor rhythm changes were explored by event-related desynchronization (ERD) changes and topographies.ResultsAfter 1 month BCI intervention, both the BCI group (p = 0.032) and the control group (p = 0.048) improved in FMA-UE scores. The BCI group (12.77\%) showed larger percentage of improvement than the control group (7.14\%), and more patients obtained good motor recovery in the BCI group (57.1\%) than did the control group (28.6\%). Patients with good recovery showed relatively higher online BCI performance, which were greater than 70\%. And they showed a continuous improvement in offline BCI performance and obtained a highest value in the last six sessions of interventions during BCI training. However, patients with poor recovery reached a platform in the first six sessions of interventions and did not improve any more or even showed a decrease. In sensorimotor rhythm, patients with good recovery showed an enhanced ERD along with time change. Topographies showed that the ipsilesional hemisphere presented stronger activations after BCI intervention.ConclusionBrain–computer interface training with exoskeleton feedback was feasible in subacute stroke patients. Brain–computer interface performance can be an index to evaluate the efficacy of BCI intervention. Patients who presented increasingly stronger or continuously strong activations (ERD) may obtain better motor recovery.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—

Low-frequency oscillations reflect brain injury but also contribute to normal behaviors. We examined hypotheses relating electroencephalography measures, including low-frequency oscillations, to injury and motor recovery poststroke.

Methods—

Patients with stroke completed structural neuroimaging, a resting-state electroencephalography recording and clinical testing. A subset admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility also underwent serial electroencephalography recordings. The relationship that electroencephalography measures (power and coherence with leads overlying ipsilesional primary motor cortex [iM1]) had with injury and motor status was assessed, focusing on delta (1–3 Hz) and high-beta (20–30 Hz) bands.

Results—

Across all patients (n=62), larger infarct volume was related to higher delta band power in bilateral hemispheres and to higher delta band coherence between iM1 and bilateral regions. In chronic stroke, higher delta power bilaterally correlated with better motor status. In subacute stroke, higher delta coherence between iM1 and bilateral areas correlated with poorer motor status. These coherence findings were confirmed in serial recordings from 18 patients in an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Here, interhemispheric coherence between leads overlying iM1 and contralesional M1 was elevated at inpatient rehabilitation facility admission compared with healthy controls (n=22), declining to control levels over time. Decreases in interhemispheric coherence between iM1 and contralesional M1 correlated with better motor recovery.

Conclusions—

Delta band coherence with iM1 related to greater injury and poorer motor status subacutely, while delta band power related to greater injury and better motor status chronically. Low-frequency oscillations reflect both injury and recovery after stroke and may be useful biomarkers in stroke recovery and rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Background. Evolution of motor function during the first months after stroke is stereotypically bifurcated, consisting of either recovery to about 70\% of maximum possible improvement (“proportional recovery, PROP”) or in little to no improvement (“poor recovery, POOR”). There is currently no evidence that any rehabilitation treatment will prevent POOR and favor PROP. Objective. To perform a longitudinal and multimodal assessment of functional and structural changes in brain organization associated with PROP. Methods. Fugl-Meyer Assessments of the upper extremity and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) were obtained from 63 patients, diffusion tensor imaging from 46 patients, at 2 and 4 weeks (T0) and at 3 months (T1) after stroke onset. Results. We confirmed the presence of 2 distinct recovery patterns (PROP and POOR) in our sample. At T0, PROP patients had greater integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) and greater EEG functional connectivity (FC) between the affected hemisphere and rest of the brain, in particular between the ventral premotor and the primary motor cortex. POOR patients suffered from degradation of corticocortical and corticofugal fiber tracts in the affected hemisphere between T0 and T1, which was not observed in PROP patients. Better initial CST integrity correlated with greater initial global FC, which was in turn associated with less white matter degradation between T0 and T1. Conclusions. These findings suggest links between initial CST integrity, systems-level cortical network plasticity, reduction of white matter atrophy, and clinical motor recovery after stroke.

	abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of motor disability worldwide. Upper limb rehabilitation is particularly challenging since approximately 35\% of patients recover significant hand function after 6 months of the stroke’s onset. Therefore, new therapies, especially those based on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and robotic assistive devices, are currently under research. Electroencephalography (EEG) acquired brain rhythms in alpha and beta bands, during motor tasks, such as motor imagery/intention (MI), could provide insight of motor-related neural plasticity occurring during a BCI intervention. Hence, a longitudinal analysis of subacute stroke patients’ brain rhythms during a BCI coupled to robotic device intervention was performed in this study. Data of 9 stroke patients were acquired across 12 sessions of the BCI intervention. Alpha and beta event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) trends across sessions and their association with time since stroke onset and clinical upper extremity recovery were analyzed, using correlation and linear stepwise regression, respectively. More EEG channels presented significant ERD/ERS trends across sessions related with time since stroke onset, in beta, compared to alpha. Linear models implied a moderate relationship between alpha rhythms in frontal, temporal, and parietal areas with upper limb motor recovery and suggested a strong association between beta activity in frontal, central, and parietal regions with upper limb motor recovery. Higher association of beta with both time since stroke onset and upper limb motor recovery could be explained by beta relation with closed-loop communication between the sensorimotor cortex and the paralyzed upper limb, and alpha being probably more associated with motor learning mechanisms. The association between upper limb motor recovery and beta activations reinforces the hypothesis that broader regions of the cortex activate during movement tasks as a compensatory mechanism in stroke patients with severe motor impairment. Therefore, EEG across BCI interventions could provide valuable information for prognosis and BCI cortical activity targets.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to assess the value of quantified electroencephalography (EEG) in the follow-up of stroke and its possible correlation with other measures of recovery.

EEGs were recorded over a period of 6 months in 34 patients with ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory who underwent spectral analysis. Two groups were formed: (1) 28 patients with a Barthel Index score of less than 60 at admission and (2) 6 patients with a Barthel score of over 60 and therefore with a much better prognosis. Ten recordings were made in each patient in the first group and at least three in the second group. Motor functions and activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed three times, on admission to the study and after 3 and 6 months.

Quantified EEG was significantly abnormal in the affected hemisphere of the first group. Side and site were not relevant. Longitudinal recordings showed a significant improvement of the power spectrum in the first 3 months. Alpha mean weighted frequency of the injured hemisphere was always slower than that of the contralateral side. All patients improved in motor performance and ADL, with the greatest gain in the first 3 months. However, no correlation between quantified EEG and clinical testing was found. By looking at individual profiles, a frequent and unpredictable instability was seen in the "unaffected" hemisphere. In those who made the best recovery, the EEG spectrum became more symmetrical over the left and right hemispheres, an aspect that continued beyond the point of a good motor and ADL recovery.

Quantified EEG undergoes early and subtle changes in the follow-up of stroke that can outlast clinical recovery. Routine evaluation for prognosis is not recommended because motor and ADL scales provide earlier and more accurate indicators. In contrast, quantified EEG can be useful for individual patients undergoing rehabilitation to monitor mechanisms of local repair and also to detect changes in the so-called normal hemisphere. It may reveal focal abnormalities that are undetected by coarse clinical evaluation and that call for appropriate neuropsychological testing.},

Objective. We aimed to investigate (1) the time course of cortical activation as revealed by EEG-based spectral characteristics during awake rest and (2) the development of these spectral characteristics in relation to global neurological and upper-limb motor recovery in the first 6 months poststroke. Methods. Resting-state EEG was measured serially in 41 patients after a first-ever ischemic stroke, within 3 and at 5, 12, and 26 weeks poststroke. We computed the brain symmetry index (BSI) and directional BSI (BSIdir) over different frequency bands (1-25 Hz, delta, theta) and delta/alpha ratio (DAR). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of the upper extremity (FM-UE) were determined as clinical reflections of spontaneous neurobiological recovery. Longitudinal changes in spectral characteristics and within- and between-subject associations with NIHSS and FM-UE were analyzed with linear mixed models. Results. Spectral characteristics showed a gradual normalization over time, within and beyond 12 weeks poststroke. Significant within- and between-subject associations with NIHSS were found for DAR of the affected hemisphere (DARAH) and BSIdirdelta. BSIdirdelta also demonstrated significant within- and between-subject associations with FM-UE. Conclusions. Changes in spectral characteristics are not restricted to the time window of recovery of clinical neurological impairments. The present study suggests that decreasing DARAH and BSIdirdelta reflect improvement of global neurological impairments, whereas BSIdirdelta was also specifically associated with upper-limb motor recovery early poststroke.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) between the primary motor area (M1) region of the brain and other brain regions may be a predictor of motor learning, although this suggestion is still controversial. In the work reported here, we investigated the relationship between M1 seed-based rs-FC and motor learning. Fifty-three healthy volunteers undertook random button-press and sequential motor learning tasks. Five-minute resting-state data acquisition was performed between the two tasks. Oscillatory neural activities during the random task and the rest period were measured using magnetoencephalography. M1 seed-based rs-FC was calculated for the alpha and beta bands using amplitude envelope correlation, in which the seed location was defined as an M1 position with peak event-related desynchronization value. The relationship between rs-FC and the performance of motor learning was examined using whole brain correlation analysis. The results showed that beta-band resting-state cross-network connectivity between the sensorimotor network and the core network, particularly the theory of mind network, affected the performance of subsequent motor learning tasks. Good learners could be distinguished from poor learners by the strength of rs-FC between the M1 and the left superior temporal gyrus, a part of the theory of mind network. These results suggest that cross-network connectivity between the sensorimotor network and the theory of mind network can be used as a predictor of motor learning performance.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of the resting brain exhibit transitions between a small number of discrete networks, each remaining stable for tens to hundreds of milliseconds. These functional microstates are thought to be the building blocks of spontaneous consciousness. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a useful tool for imaging microstates, and EEG microstate analysis can potentially give insight into altered brain dynamics underpinning cognitive impairment in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since EEG is non-invasive and relatively inexpensive, EEG microstates have the potential to be useful clinical tools for aiding early diagnosis of AD. In this study, EEG was collected from two independent cohorts of probable AD and cognitively healthy control participants, and a cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with four-year clinical follow-up. The microstate associated with the frontoparietal working-memory/attention network was altered in AD due to parietal inactivation. Using a novel measure of complexity, we found microstate transitioning was slower and less complex in AD. When combined with a spectral EEG measure, microstate complexity could classify AD with sensitivity and specificity {\textgreater} 80\%, which was tested on an independent cohort, and could predict progression from MCI to AD in a small preliminary test cohort of 11 participants. EEG microstates therefore have potential to be a non-invasive functional biomarker of AD.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous mental activity is characterized by dynamic alterations of discrete and stabile brain states called functional microstates that are thought to represent distinct steps of human information processing. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly reflects functioning of brain synapses with a uniquely high temporal resolution, necessary for investigation of brain network dynamics. Since synaptic dysfunction is an early event and best correlate of cognitive status and decline in patients along Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, EEG microstates might serve as valuable early markers of AD. The present study investigated differences in EEG microstate topographies and parameters (duration, occurrence and contribution) between a large cohort of healthy elderly (n = 308) and memory clinic patients: subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 210); mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 230) and AD (n = 197) and how they correlate to conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD. Four most representative microstate maps assigned as classes A, B (asymmetrical), C and D (symmetrical) were computed from the resting state EEGs since it has been shown previously that this is sufficient to explain most of the resting state EEG data. Statistically different topography of microstate maps were found between the controls and the patient groups for microstate classes A, C and D. Changes in the topography of microstate class C were associated with the CSF Aβ42 levels, whereas changes in the topography of class B were linked with the CSF p-tau levels. Gradient-like increase in the contribution of asymmetrical (A and B) and gradient-like decrease in the contribution of symmetrical (C and D) maps were observed with the more severe stage of cognitive impairment. Our study demonstrated extensive relationship of resting state EEG microstates topographies and parameters with the stage of cognitive impairment and AD biomarkers. Resting state EEG microstates might therefore serve as functional markers of early disruption of neurocognitive networks in patients along AD continuum.},

	abstract = {We aimed to identify features associated with different disease trajectories in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related primary progressive aphasia (PPA). We considered 23 patients diagnosed with AD-related PPA. All patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation, 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET brain scan, CSF biomarkers measurement and APOE genotype analysis at baseline and underwent neurological follow-up for a mean time of 3 years. Patients who progressed to total loss of speech (TLoS+) had greater impairment in writing and higher t-tau concentration as compared to TLoS– patients. Patients who progressed to loss of functional autonomy (LoFA+) had greater impairment in single-word comprehension as compared to patients who maintained autonomy in self-care. Furthermore, 18F-FDG-PET SPM analyses revealed different brain metabolic patterns between TLoS+ and TLoS– and between LoFA+ and LoFA–. In conclusion, linguistic profile, CSF t-tau and brain metabolic pattern might be useful tools to predict progression to total loss of speech and loss of functional autonomy in AD-related PPA patients.},
